It cracks to splinters between his teeth. Incredibly tasty splinters, the consistency of which have absolutely no existential baggage to them. The splinters dissolve quickly, leaving behind the impression they were made of nothing at all, but for a cloying essence determined to linger behind. With some distance from his traumatic anime dreaming, the fatalistic mood that he’s been walking around with all day seems somewhat... melodramatic. Embarrassing, even! Who has time for nihilism when it’s such a beautiful day.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: you know what?</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: ... </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: maybe i’ll stay after all.</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: r... rly?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: yeah. now that i’ve had some time to think about, is lord english really that big of a deal?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i mean, i know rose said it was a big deal.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: that canon would... “dissipate,” if i didn’t go do it. whatever that means.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: isn’t it just as likely that i could mess up a whole bunch of stuff if i go back there? </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: the idea of going back in time, or back into canon, or whatever...  </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: and fighting this huge battle that serves some vague purpose i’m not sure i even understand...  </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: it feels so... heavy?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: and i’m not feeling that heavy, suddenly. i feel kind of the opposite, actually.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i feel like, maybe i just don’t give a shit? </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i don’t mean in a bad way, it’s just...  </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: well, i’m already HERE. living my life, with my friends, and...  </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i think i just want to stay back on earth, forget i ever heard of lord english, and just... relax? </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: is that selfish of me??</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i dunno, just seems like a lot of responsibility for one person. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: so maybe instead of taking the fate of everyone’s existence into my own hands, i should just... </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: stay here and try to enjoy life?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Even John has to admit, his rationale doesn’t sound particularly satisfying. Now that he’s reflecting on everything he just said, it really strikes him as a bunch of empty-headed babble. But then again, it’s like he was saying. His head <em>does</em> feel lighter. Maybe he doesn’t care if his reasoning sucks? Maybe he just doesn’t care about any of the high stakes or existential gravity related to his conversation with Rose. Maybe he doesn’t care about much of anything, except the here and now, the company of his friends, and the pleasant breeze flowing through the park today. He’s feeling quite insubstantial, when he thinks about it. Superficial. And a bit sappy toward his friends. So what if he wants to make an insubstantial, superficial, and sappy decision?</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: are you absolUtely sUre aboUt this, john?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">He looks up at the trees, at the sunlight glittering through the crisscrossing fronds. Has the sky always been that blue? A leaf spirals down lazily and lands on his forehead. He plucks it off and studies the veins running through it. At each fork in the veins, he supposes the leaf as a whole is making a certain kind of “decision,” to go this way or that. It certainly seems like one way of looking at a leaf, now that he bothers to really scrutinize one. It also seems to him, with just as great a sense of clarity, that not one of this leaf’s decisions ever mattered even the tiniest fucking bit to anybody. Not to the tree, not to the world, not even to the leaf itself. He flicks the delicate green metaphor away with a flourish of disdain, and sudden conviction. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: yeah. actually, i don’t think i’ve ever been so sure of anything in my life.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Roxy’s stoic countenance washes away abruptly and she lets out a happy... <em>squeal</em>? No, that’s kind of a sexist way to describe it. It’s definitely a girly noise, though, and not what John was expecting. Without warning, she launches herself into his arms.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: omg john</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: thats...  </p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: AMAZING!</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: im so stoked!!! :D</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She buries her nose in the crook of his neck… and starts crying. <em>Huh?</em> She’s definitely sniffing a little, and his skin feels wet against hers. John makes incidental eye contact with Calliope when he raises his arms to wrap them around Roxy’s back. He’s startled for a moment, but Callie’s just looking at him with that big, serene smile on her skull. So, okay, this isn’t weird or anything, this super-intimate physical interaction he’s having with her maybe-girlfriend right in front of her. It’s just that Roxy’s been so distant for years, and now John has no idea where the boundaries are drawn. </p>
    <p>He grins and hugs her back just as hard as she’s hugging him. Maybe his friendships aren’t as damaged as he’d worried. Maybe it’s like his friends were his actual family this whole time, and they were just waiting for him to pick up the phone, or to come along and hug them.</p>
    <p>Roxy pulls back and claps excitedly.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: this is gonna be so effing AWESOME</p>

    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: what i mean is that i think we’ve all had a hard time moving on from what we experienced in oUr old Universes.</p>

    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: someone that *only* yoU can help.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Calliope leans in close. The angle of the sun makes it so that she dips into shadow. The sharp recesses of her skeletal face turn those shadows black. For a moment, her voice sounds the way wind does when it howls through a narrow chasm.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: of coUrse!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">John glances at Roxy, seeking support. She smiles at him benignly, apparently having no opinion whatsoever on this topic.</p>
    <p>Sure. Okay. He can’t help but make a disgusted face at the thought of it, but he shrugs. Why the hell not? He’s feeling <em>lighter</em>, remember? If it’s time to let go of his long-held worries and hangups, then so too it may be time to let loose a long-suffering clown. If this is to be the Age of Redemption, then let it begin, he decides. Not with a bang, but a honk. </p></div>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Love? Is that how John feels about Roxy? He glances around at this beautiful restaurant she’s taken him to. Marble walls, a domed ceiling, alien plants growing up the scaffolding to the second floor... it’s lit by a cobweb of ultrathin clear wire strung with lights so that it looks like there are fireflies suspended above in the fake night sky. It’s a good place to fall in love, probably. </p>
    <p>He turns his head to see that Gamzee has stepped outside, and now monitors the date with his face pressed against the window. He’s smearing his disgusting makeup against the glass without the slightest concern for propriety. John accidentally makes eye contact with him, and Gamzee gives him a thumbs-up. A chill runs down John’s spine, so he goes back to his conversation with Terezi.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Roxy finally comes back from the restroom. He hears her heels click-clacking on the floor, and shoves his phone into his pocket in a panic, before he can follow up on the last line of his message. He doesn’t know why he does it in a panic. It’s not like he’s doing anything wrong. In fact, tapping away on the phone when someone leaves you alone at a table is completely and totally normal. Maybe it’s just that it’s kind of weird to be talking to a girl under the table while on a date with a completely different girl, no matter what his respective relationships with those two girls might be.</p>
    <p>His internal Rose-voice tsks at him for having such a gender-essentialist thought. He wonders if he’d feel quite as guilty if he were talking to Rose under the table instead of Terezi. Probably not, which is a whole tangle of stuff he doesn’t even want to think about. He shoots Roxy a big, bright grin when she slips into her seat. She grins back.</p>
    <p>He is genuinely glad to be here. Roxy is beautiful. The restaurant is beautiful. He feels like he’s fumbling at something existentially beautiful here. There’s something about the way she’s looking at him that makes him glad he got out of bed today. It makes him, for the first time in years, excited about the idea that the future is a thing that exists.</p>

    <p class="roxy">ROXY: yea!!</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: just a feelin i get </p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: like this fancy dress is a costume</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: like im just playacting at being a grown-up woman</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: yeah, i know that feeling. what even are adults?</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: good question!</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: when i was a kid i just thought adulthood was something that happened to you automatically, i think.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: like the moment i turned eighteen a briefcase would appear in my hand and i’d have it all figured out, just like my dad seemed to.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i can’t believe i’m twenty-three and still a huge loser! i wonder if my dad ever thought that way about himself, like he was just some big dumb kid totally messing everything up but trying to keep up appearances anyway.</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: dont say that about urself dummy!</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: so... i’m a dummy, but i shouldn’t call myself dumb?</p>

It makes a very quiet squeaking noise that he can hear over the mumbled conversation around him because they’re sitting so very close. Her lashes look about twice as long in the low, pale light. They shadow her eyes so that he can’t read her expression.</p>

    <p class="roxy">ROXY: but thats not exactly a useful example in this situation</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i dunno. i think sacrificing yourself to take down a brutal clown dictatorship is a pretty good life lesson to internalize in any situation.</p>

    <p class="roxy">ROXY: just u and ur brain contemplating the infinite loneliness of singular consciousness in a vast cold universe</p>

    <p class="no-indent">John lifts his glass as a cute and cliché thing to do, expecting no reciprocation. But she laughs and actually humors him. The glasses clink together clumsily, and water gets all over the complimentary breadsticks. She starts laughing harder.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">For some reason, those words make the pit in his stomach grow. He lets out a nervous giggle. His arm starts to shake, so violently that he gets even more water on the free breadsticks. Hoo boy—he’s sweating under the collar. It’s a panic, like what he felt when Roxy almost caught him texting Terezi under the table, except in reverse. What about Calliope, he thinks. John can’t tell what Roxy is thinking. She’s so warm and open and inviting, but when John looks into her eyes... it’s almost like staring into a voi—</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="no-indent">He whips his head around to see... Dave? He’s running down the street, looking back and forth like a hunted man. He spots John and freezes for a moment, obviously trying to compose himself. No one goes still quite like a Strider. He brushes past Gamzee, who is still glued to the window to spy on the date, and swaggers into the restaurant. The look on his face seems to suggest he’s about to throw up, but he keeps it together. His entrance is so smooth that all the dining carapacians in the vicinity immediately stop talking and stare at him as he glides to the table.</p>
    <p>Dave sets his hand just in front of the free breadsticks and angles a look at John through the panels of his shades. It looks like he hasn’t slept, but it’s hard to tell with Dave. He’s out of breath.</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: which is a lot i guess</p>

    <p class="roxy">ROXY: yea ill just be here eatin breadsticks since we didnt actually order dinner</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: cool! i’ll be right back!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dave shoves his hands in his pockets and leads John out into the cool evening air. Gamzee offers a double thumbs-up as they walk past him, which John fiercely ignores.</p>
    <p>John does, however, check his phone. Subtly, but a little desperately. He left Terezi hanging in the middle of a sentence and he’s gotta admit, as much fun as he’s been having with Roxy, there’s an annoying little voice screaming at him underneath everything else he’s done and said tonight that desperately needs to know what else Terezi had to say. Behind Dave’s back as he leads the way, John swipes the screen to catch up with her answers, smiling conspiratorially. </p></div>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: ok as much as i appreciate how weird a thing that was to say</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: i might not exactly be the expert, but kissing seems pretty easy, dave.</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: no dude thats dumb</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: you should know this cause youve done the retcon thing</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: what does that have to do with flipping coins?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: ok so every time you flip a coin youre creating an alternate timeline right</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: one where it lands heads and one where it lands tails </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: but while the coin is flipping both possibilities exist simultaneously</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: but what if you knew for sure that you’d make the same decision no matter which side landed up?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: you cant</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: so... it’s like the coin never lands then?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: sure</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: then if you dated *both* jade and karkat it’d be like you’re winning the schrodinger’s cat paradox.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: uh yeah thats another theoretical paradox that i think you gotta read up on a bit more there buddy</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i probably won’t, but ok.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: fair enough</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: but yes metaphysics aside me dating both jade and karkat at the same time literally is the issue at hand and  it is that with which i currently and explicitly struggle</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: yeah.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: sure seems that way.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: so...  </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i dunno, dave. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: this all just... it doesn’t sound *right* to me.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">John thinks about the speech Rose gave him that morning on her couch, about canon veracity and the validity or nonvalidity of subjective actions the further they get away from the “intended” sequence of events. Something about... pillars? What is essential, true, and relevant. He remembers those three words, but no other contextual remarks which bind them. That conversation seems so very long ago now.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dave staggers uneasily to his feet, staring way past John like he’s looking into the infinity of his own soul right now. John’s never seen him so scared, and it’s over what seems like a pretty easy choice as far as John’s concerned. It sure isn’t easy for him, though. John guesses this is what it means to be a friend. It means being the guy who understands when easy isn’t actually that easy.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i have to... talk to dirk i think</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: uh, ok?</p>

    <p class="no-indent">John wonders when talking to Dirk has fixed anything for anyone. </p>
    <p>He’s about to ask what exactly it is he needs to talk to Dirk about, but then remembers what he saw when he went back to fetch Gamzee’s fridge in the Medium: Dirk and Dave hugging on the edge of the roof, sharing something private and mysterious, the sort of thing that can only happen between two people whose personalities are cracked in the same way. It’s not something John’s ever had, so it’s not something he can understand. An uncomfortable silence lingers between the two of them. Before John can fill it with some stupid words, he hears Roxy calling up to him from below. He pops his head over the roof and waves at her.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: what’s up?</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: yo boys not to interrupt but we got kicked outta the restaurant for not ordering</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: what? really? </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: what’s even the point of being famous if that can happen?</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: lmao i know right</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: uh, sounds good! i’ll see you there soon!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She grins up at John with shimmering, adoring eyes. They’re reflecting every star in the sky, all for him. It makes his heart do a weird somersault. It tries to flip frontways, then backwards, and ends up landing on its face instead. He’s feeling too many contradictory things right now. When he turns to look at Dave again, he’s practically translucent. Barely there, half out the door emotionally. John feels like he could have done more, like this whole conversation was sand running through his fingers. It itches at the back of his head, the idea that he might have just fucked up Dave’s entire life. </p>

    <p>Not that waking up to limbs entwined with some fleeting dalliance was a unfamiliar sensation by any means, but this time something seems off. He’s afraid to open his eyes, because he can’t remember the last few days. The very last thing he does remember—if any of his recollections are to be trusted—is corking open a bottle of alchemized merlot at nine in the morning, as one does, and then doing a brisk session of target practice, which was interrupted by...  </p>
    <p>By... </p>
    <p>Oh fuck. </p>
    <p>Jake’s eyes snap open. His ceiling looks the same as it always does, if a bit tizzy with the eye-splitting headache sending nails of pain through his skull. The gold-flecked flowers carved into his wood-paneled ceiling glitter in the morning light. Jake stares very hard at them because he doesn’t want to look down and confirm his worst fears. </p>
    <p>But his worst fears are confirmed for him without him having to do anything, unfortunately, which seems par for the course.</p>

They linger in the dip above her hips. Her hair is tousled and she’s not wearing her glasses. Jake actually has to catch his breath at the sight of her. It’s not her attractiveness that was ever in question. It’s everything else about this situation which is the problem.</p>

    <p class="jane">JANE: Lighten up Jake! The election’s off! The economy is stable! Dirk is probably never going to talk to us ever again! And we just... we finally fucked. Hoo hoo hoo!</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Did we indeed fuck? Was it merely playing honky tonky with our digits, or did we do the ole gamahuche? Or even worse, the beardsplitting?</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She crawls towards him with a goofy smile, padding along unsteadily because she can’t see shit without her spectacles. Jake shoots up in bed and scuttles all the way back, until his shoulders hit the frame. Something catches the corner of his eye, and he swivels his head around to see the Trickster Lollipop on his bedside table. It sits, like evidence at a murder scene, beneath an empty bottle of vodka and far more sets of underwear than the number of people accounted for in the room.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">...Jake says, but Jane shuts him up with a finger over his lips. She slides into his lap and settles her bottom into the space between his thighs. There’s a blanket between the lurid parts of their naked bodies, but Jake cannot rightly move unless he wishes to be dearly compromised. He stutters through several objections, but Jane is plucking all his strings quite mercilessly. He feels like a snake about to be necked by a mongoose.</p>

    <p class="jane">JANE: We, er... had quite a bit to drink over the course of the day, and one thing led to another...</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Led to partaking in scandalous confections?!</p>

    <p class="jake">JAKE: Criminy!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jane’s expression falls. She’d been feeling quite buoyed after a night of jolly—if inebriated—fun, but Jake does not seem to share her enthusiasm.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Dear me... was that innuendo a bit too much? I’m sorry. I’m not very good at this.</p>

They don’t need to. Dave can hear his brother’s voice in his head.</p>
    <p>Not, like, literally. That would be insane. But Dave knows what his bro is like. Dirk, or a version of him, instilled in Dave a way of living and thinking that would, for better or worse, persist far beyond the first thirteen years of his upbringing. And even on Earth C, it’d be kind of tough to say the dude’s general overbearing demeanor wasn’t sufficient to perpetuate the conditioning. So it’s rare he has to guess what Dirk would say he should do.</p>
    <p>But when it comes to the boondoggle involved with triangulating his interpersonal relationships with Jade and Karkat, Dave is shooting blanks. He has no idea what to do, no idea what to say, and for once, the ghost in his head doesn’t either.</p>
    <p>Once he might have expected the end of the haunting to come as a relief. But now that he finally sits quietly in his own mind, with nothing but his meager faculties to guide his hand, the silence is deafening.</p>
    <p>There’s no time to waste, so he flies directly to his bro’s studio. He needs this. He needs his bro to tell him what to do. Whatever issues the guy might have, Dave has always been able to count on Dirk to give him, as Jake might say, the solid dick. </p>
    <p>Dave knocks on the door, loud, but there’s no answer. Nothing when he calls out Dirk’s name either. Then he tries the knob, and the door swings right open.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dave has had enough of this buffoon. He pushes Gamzee aside, and the clown goes absolutely flying into one of Dirk’s messy work benches. The vagrant jester ricochets off disorganized piles of scrap metal and anime paraphernalia like a <em>Tony Hawk</em> jackass clipping and flopping into an unending oblivion of pain. The circus ruckus starts a vicious Rube Goldberg machine of cartoon physics, knocking every cinder block, crusty puppet, and Japanese sword in a tornado’s radius off balance and avalanching them catastrophically onto the hapless clown’s torso.</p>
    <p>Dave gives only a second glance to the ludicrous pandemonium. He blows open the door to the stairwell and heads down, bracing himself for the worst. But he doesn’t find Dirk in the basement either.</p>
    <p>The only thing of note is a slumped figure in the center of the storage room, covered in a thin sheet. Dave approaches and rips it off to discover... Wait. What is this?</p>
    <p>It’s obviously a robot, but it’s a complete mess. The form is feminine, but the head is still bald, and the face has no cover, revealing its skull-like interior. The body doesn’t have any proper protective plating yet, so it’s all a mess of wires and loose mechanical bits. Clearly a work in progress. But Dave can’t help but wonder what exactly it is that Dirk’s been working on here?</p>
    <p>Then Dave notices the note. It’s carefully folded in the limp palm of the robot’s hand. His heart jumps into his throat, and something in his stomach drops.</p>
    <p>Oh, no.</p></div>

    <p>The decision was made the moment John chose his course. This world has been set on a path that you cannot tread.</p>
    <p>You stand beneath the carapacian bell tower, poised to climb to the top. You’ve brought nothing with you but a long length of rope, coiled in your steady fist. It is the only thing that you need.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Ascend.</p>
    <p>You do not hesitate. Your legs feel impressively powerful as you begin to climb the staircase, two steps at a time. There is nothing of consequence but your singular task.</p>
    <p>You left a note, but you don’t expect any of your friends to understand. It’s not important that they do. A flip of the cosmic coin has rendered your entire life completely inessential. What could you accomplish in a dead-end existence like this? There are no stakes. No meaningful challenges. No structures or themes—only residual chemical reactions in a dying brain, a physical system’s obligate compulsion to exhaust its own lingering momentum. A cockroach with its head cut off, waiting to die of thirst.</p>
    <p>Halfway up the tower, you take flight. Every second you waste here is a drain on the concept of existence itself. You whip up the hollow vertical shaft at the center of the spiraling stairs and erupt into the air beneath the bell. You land on the ledge overlooking the Carapace Kingdom below and cast a cursory glance across the landscape beneath you. Its beautiful scenery is a comical illusion of no matter to you. </p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Get to work.</p>
    <p>Your hands move methodically to fashion the hangman’s noose. It is a gesture you have practiced well. You bunch a section of the rope into an S, and loop the end of the rope around its middle. Seven wraps, and you’re done. You tie it off at the bottom, then tug the rope taut. </p>
    <p>The corrosion has already begun. You can feel the gears slowing, all the intricate, unseen mechanisms coming unhinged from their mooring and drifting apart.</p>
    <p>Your friends might derive some sense of fulfillment from satisfying the elementary obligations of self-preservation and self-propagation, but there’s nothing here for you. It doesn’t matter anymore.</p>
    <p>There is a beam across the opening of the face of the bell tower that will serve as a convenient anchor for the rope. You toss the noose up over the beam and then rise to fasten the knot. You ensure that it is secure. There can be no mistakes.</p>
    <p>You touch back down on the ledge of the tower. You bring the noose over your head and pull it tight.</p>
    <p>Your choice is not between that of life and death. It is between an ignominious dissolution at the hands of entropy, and one final act of relevance that can bequeath your meager energies to the cosmic well from whence they came.</p>
    <p>In a certain sense, you’ve never felt so free.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Kill yourself.</p>
    <p>You jump.</p>
    <p>A meaningful death would, of course, be quick. Brutal. An expeditious descent, a splash of crimson at the base of the bell tower, a body that looks otherwise intact if you don’t flip it over to see the dark, mottled bruises where the fetid, septic blood has begun to pool. You made certain that the rope was long enough for the velocity of your fall to immediately decapitate you. It slices through the air with a vicious whipping sound, unspooling in even, silk-smooth rotations. Just as your epiphany occured at sunset, your death must occur at sunrise to complete the ouroboros of symbological harmonic resonance that is your personal arc. </p>
    <p>It is the very last moment of narratively consequential action that will happen in this whole, barren world. The few carapacians unfortunate enough to have left their homes this early in the morning will remember this moment forever, but in reality, it lasts only half a second. The noise your cervical spine makes when it sunders is indescribably gruesome. Many of the bystanders who witness your death will later attempt to recount it, but there really are no words that can adequately express the sound someone makes when they die. It’s a phenomenon that happens on two levels. First, there is the literal termination of organic processes, which is to say, the destruction of the meat. Then follows the dissolution of the ego. And you have quite the ego to dissolve, one that has flown so high above the forest that not only can it no longer see the trees, it cannot even conceive of the trees as material substance with objective meaning. </p>
    <p>Yours is a singularity of narcissism—an endlessly recursive existence so dense that it has no choice but to sprawl out much further than the boundaries of its person in any given universe or timeline. Once cut off from that, you become unbearably dispensable. From a purely utilitarian perspective, killing yourself is the greatest gift you could give to this dying world. A valorous sacrifice the likes of which this place will never experience again. If your severed head could speak, it might say, “You’re welcome.” But even then, maybe it wouldn’t. It might not care enough to do this shallow realm even that basic courtesy. We may never know.</p>
    <p>Your severed head remains suspended in the loop of the noose, tight under your jaw, while your limp body bounces off the side of the bell tower and tumbles to the grass.</p>
    <p>Screams sound from below. The horrified carapacian bystanders scatter and run. Your body tumbles down the side of the hill, spraying blood from its neck in a volume that makes the foot of the tower look like the scene of a massacre. </p>
    <p>Your heart keeps beating well after you’re dead. It keeps beating until every drop of blood is forced from your corpse, a sea of gore drenching the earth beneath the scene of your demise.</p>
    <p>Your body doesn’t get up, and your head doesn’t open its eyes. When you think so little of yourself as a moral character, any act of self-termination will result in a death that is Just. </p></div>

It rains just seldom enough on this idyllic world that most of its inhabitants are conditioned to leave their homes without umbrellas, and today they’re paying for it. The press clamors at the edges of the funeral procession, getting soaked to the bone and/or exoskeleton. John ducks his head away from the flash of cameras, still uncomfortable with his position among the pallbearers. He didn’t know Dirk that well, but he couldn’t refuse a direct request from a grieving bro. He ventures a glance at Dave, who is at the front of the line carrying a smaller casket containing Dirk’s decapitated head. </p>
    <p>The actual casket is unusually heavy, not just because Jane insisted on having it crafted from the finest-quality timber on the planet, but also because for some unfathomable reason Dirk is going to be buried with every single one of his shitty anime swords. It would be absurd were it not so tragic, and possibly also predictable. Gamzee fumbles with his corner of the casket when it comes time to set it down in the cathedral, upsets the balance of the whole thing, and sends it careening down so hard that the nose of it crashes right through the stage.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="gamzee">GAMZEE: OoOpS mOtHeRfUcKeRs.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: oops???</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: its fine gamz</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: accidents happen</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">John presses his mouth into a flat line. He looks at Dirk’s casket, sitting diagonally in a hole in the floor and popped about 13% of the way open. A few shitty swords seem to have made a valiant effort to escape, but didn’t quite make it all the way. He looks at Dave, who appears even more stoic than usual, with his wet hair plastered to his forehead. He looks at Roxy, who is staring at the floor, rather beside herself in grief. Then, finally, he looks back to Gamzee, who offers two dubiously sympathetic “whoops” in response.</p>
    <p>Today is not the day to push it, he thinks to himself. He forces a smile, kisses Roxy on the cheek and goes to take his seat in the front row of the pews. At the back of the nave, devastated fans of <em>RUMBLE IN DA PUMPKIN PATCH</em> are trying to force their way inside, past the barrier of reporters. Jane drags Jake off by the wrist to deal with them as Roxy approaches the pulpit, looking miserably ghostlike in her violet mourning clothes. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: um</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: hey thx everyone for joining me today </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She folds her hands in front of her. Her earrings light up as the reporters at the back take about six million pictures of her tear-stained face. She sniffs, then hocks back a whole mouthful of snot. The sound is very much in contrast with the delicate, feminine manner with which she tugs a tissue out of her modest cleavage in order to dab at her eyes.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: wow now that im up here its like</p>

    <p class="roxy">ROXY: and i guess thats cuz there IS nothing to say</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: theres no words to describe how i felt about dirk strider</p>

    <p class="roxy">ROXY: which is just like dirk i guess</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: to leave us with a load of bullshit and no idea why he did what he did</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: so im just gonna say that</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dave gets to his feet, unwinding his fingers from Jade’s. He walks to the pulpit with his usual smoothness but pauses beneath the giant stained glass window to run the heel of his palm under his shades. The camera bulbs start clacking away like crazy. John whirls around in his seat to glare at the reporters, putting a finger to his mouth to shoosh them. He watches a tiny, white-carapaced chess guy sheepishly press the flash button on his camera as quietly as possible.</p>
    <p>It takes Dave a moment to gather himself when he reaches the lectern, but when he speaks his voice is steady and even.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: hey guys</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: the idea that he could eventually become that kind of person</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: or even worse that he was somehow cosmically fated to become that person no matter what he wanted or did to prevent it</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: thats prolly how he managed to off himself in the first place considering how the mechanics of god tier works</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: etc</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: and part of thats cause i got to be friends with dirk</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: it was great getting to know this rad version of my childhood guardian who wasnt completely batshit insane</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: and like just chill with him</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: shoot the shit and freestyle or debate dumb crap without it being a federal fucking issue</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: he let me give him shit for being a pretentious blowhard every day of his life</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: which i did</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: but despite that i</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i looked up to him </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: the way i always felt like i should have been looking up to my bro</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: the way i WANTED to look up to my bro but couldnt</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: dirk taught me so much shit i didnt know i needed from him</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i mean picking up dirks opinions was unavoidable if you ever hung out with him considering he never shut his fucking mouth</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: but im glad he didnt</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: he taught me about combat</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: philosophy</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: life</p>

She brushes Kanaya’s hand off her lap and goes to stand, but is interrupted by the horrible, squelching sound of Gamzee lumbering to his feet in his wet, oversized boots. He saunters up to the pulpit with the precise lazy gait of one who’s grown far too comfortable with a lifelong tendency of unwittingly inspiring others’ contempt, and braces his arms on either side of the lectern. If inside this church there were an adjacent room full of wet dogs eating garbage, everyone in attendance would run to that room immediately to escape the stench emanating from this smiling clown. Suddenly, his expression distorts, to become something which can only be described as a leer.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">The clown thrusts his hand somewhere beneath the waistband of his pants and starts obscenely rooting around. He retrieves a piece of paper, crumpled and soaked from the rain outside, and attempts to smooth it out over the lectern. The wet paper breaks apart immediately beneath his oafish clown paws.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">It goes on like this for some time. Members of the audience ride out the clown’s eulogy with an admirable sense of grit and determination, though visibly reacting with full body spasms every time the preacher issues another punctuating honk or deeply inappropriate turn of phrase. Karkat continues heckling him all throughout, and at one point delivers no less than thirty uninterrupted instances of the phrase “FUCK YOU.” Throughout most of the eulogy, Roxy continues attempting to urge others to settle down and give him a chance, based on the many endorsements she’s heard of his spiritual oration skills. But even she gives up on this effort when one especially boisterous honk results in Gamzee knocking over the lectern entirely, which he does not bother to pick up. Instead, he proceeds with his eulogy as if nothing happened, while openly scratching an itch beneath his codpiece.</p>
    <p>At this point, Dave has had enough, and exits the church. Karkat follows him. Gamzee inhales deeply, preparing to launch into what quite possibly will be the full body of his speech, rather than one or two mercifully concluding remarks. Roxy stands up and begins clapping loudly to bring a heroic end to the elocutionary horror show.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">John mutters a few imprecations under his breath and gets up before Jake can take the stage. He’s concerned about Dave and heads for the exit, beating Gamzee there easily. Gamzee’s strolling so leisurely, in fact, he’s barely even made it off the stage yet.</p>
    <p>John pushes out into the churchyard. The rain has receded into a light drizzle, which is nice. Much less like being being trapped in a high-pressure shower and more like being sprayed with a plant mister. He looks around the largely decorative graveyard and spots Dave and Karkat huddled together beneath an eave of the churchyard walls. John begins to move towards them but stops when he notices how close together they’re standing. Dave’s got his suit jacket unbuttoned and pulled over Karkat’s head to shield him from the rain. Karkat’s the one talking—his caterpillar eyebrows furrowed, but his gaze soft. Whatever he’s saying makes Dave turn his face away, but Karkat winds a hand in his shirt and tugs him in, forces him to make eye contact. They both go still, seeming to finally realize how close their faces have gotten, how Karkat’s fingers are brushing down the length of Dave’s torso. Dave dips down so that their noses are bumping. Karkat’s eyes are so wide it’s amazing they don’t pop out. For a moment, it looks like they’re going to...  </p>
    <p>John sneezes.</p>
    <p>Dave and Karkat jump apart like opposing magnets.</p>

    <p>They make a quick recovery.</p>

    <p>John nods, swallowing hard. His throat is dry all of a sudden. Dave turns and walks back into the church. Once John is absolutely sure Dave is gone, he closes his eyes, breathes in deep through the nose and raises both his hands.</p>
    <p>Nothing happens.</p>
    <p>John cracks one eye open. It’s been a while since he’s tried to do... well, anything more complicated than going out for dinner to be honest. Has he just forgotten how to invoke his game powers?</p>
    <p>Do the windy thing, he thinks to himself. A brisk breeze howls through the graveyard, rustling some leaves off a nearby tree.</p>
    <p>Nope, that’s all good.</p>
    <p>Do the... retcon thing? He thinks much, much harder than he thought about doing the last thing. </p>

John feels like he’s missing something important here, like he went for a bathroom break during the part of the movie where the plot twist happens. He should give Roxy some time, get himself some space. It’s all happened so fast that it’s suffocating.</p>

Like a quick plunge into cold water, a feeling that grows unexamined, and then gets so big that the realization washes over you like a wave? Roxy’s unbearably beautiful with moisture clinging to her eyelashes and a smile that she’s only smiling because of how much she likes him. She likes him so much that she wants to be around him every single day! John’s stomach feels like it’s doing pirouettes. His hands come up around Roxy’s shoulders, and keep going until he’s cupping her face in both hands. He starts giggling.</p>

It’s kind of impossible not to, when Rose and Kanaya keep saying the name “Vriska” every five minutes. He really thought they were done with hearing about Vriska all the time, but apparently Rose and Kanaya were intent on breathing new life into that tradition.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Vriska, don’t chew on your chair’s dinner tray.</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Darling She Is Only A Grub She Hasnt Yet Grown Her Aural Canals</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes, but I believe strongly that we should get in the habit of speaking to her like an adult. It will be good for her social development.</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Is That How Your Mother Raised You</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I would have loved it if my mother spoke more frankly with me. But she was...  </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Let’s just say, a rather awkward person.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Er. No offense, Roxy.</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: lmao none taken</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: i cant even imagine all the ways id fuck up a kid in a timeline where i didnt sort out my drinking tbh</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Oh, you weren’t awful.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I just have...  </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: How do you always put it, dear?</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: A Penchant For Melodrama</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: well yeah</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: ur dad made sure he got some of himself in u</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I suppose he did.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">And then everyone in the room observes a moment of silence for their dear, departed friend, Dirk Strider. Except for John, who takes advantage of the solemn distraction to anxiously tap at his phone. He’d sent Terezi a text an hour ago, when Roxy was fixing her makeup in her compact. He’s not sure why he feels the need to hide the fact that he’s talking to her. It’s not like there’s anything untoward about what he’s doing. Just texting an old friend. What’s wrong with that? Nothing at all, he thinks, as he closely monitors his silent, praying wife, ready to stash the phone in his pocket the moment she shows the slightest sign of movement.</p>
    <p>She lifts her head to speak. He’s like Houdini with that phone.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: damn i still cant believe dirks gone tho</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes, it was so sudden. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But the best we can do to honor him is simply to move on with our lives.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I’m sure it’s what he would have wanted.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: huh?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">John shoots Rose a weird look. She smiles back benignly, then goes to collect her troll daughter from her booster seat. She holds baby Vriska close to her chest and leans over to give Kanaya a kiss on the cheek. The precious grub is framed between them, and the two wives are ringed in a halo of pale light at the peak of this magical moment. It should be a beautiful image, but something about it roils John’s gut. Rose sits back down, cradles Vriska in one arm, and begins to unbutton the top of her shirt with the other. John instinctively finds something else to look at. Anything. His fidgeting hands will do.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Have You Two Thought About What To Name Your Grubs</p>

    <p class="roxy">ROXY: errrr </p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: why</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Well Dont They Have To Eat Their Way Out Of The Womb</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Kanaya... </p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Its What Karkat Told Me</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Karkat gets all his information on humanity from the movies. And Dave, which is even worse than the movies.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: wait a fucking minute. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: what MOVIES are they watching??</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Nothing too graphically misleading, I suspect. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I equally suspect that any time there’s a human birthing moment on camera, Karkat probably turns away, too disgusted to watch, while Dave continues filling his ear with more lies about human biology.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: lol.</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Then</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: I Was Given Inaccurate Information</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes.</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Whew</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: If that was true, how would our species have survived? We would have had a one hundred percent maternal mortality rate during childbirth.</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Yes I Forgot How Primitive Medical Technology Was On Your Planet</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Then How Are Humans Born</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: um. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I’m sorry, John. All this girl talk must be making you uncomfortable.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: can we change the subject to something less gross and weird?</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: pff</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: wuss</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: so...  </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: is vriska really the name you’re going with?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Kanaya gives John an inquisitive, wide-eyed look. As if there could be no conceivable reason for someone to ask this question.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Yes Of Course</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Why would we change her name when she’s nearly a year old?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: well it’s not like it would hurt or anything. didn’t kanaya just say she doesn’t have ears yet?</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: omg john dont be rude</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i’m not trying to be rude!</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i just think it’s a little... weird.</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: I Dont See Why I Mean She Is Practically A Clone Of Vriska</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: uh, yeah kanaya, i know. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: that’s why it’s weird!</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I appreciate your concern, John. But it’s not that weird to name a child after an important figure from your youth.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: What were you thinking of naming your own child?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">John hesitates, adjusts his glasses for want of something to do with his hands. This is a conversation he’s been dragging his heels on for months. Back when Roxy first got pregnant it was all they talked about it, but now that she’s so close to the due date, all the subject does is make his pulse go shaky.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: um... </p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: harry anderson egbert </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: roxy! we hadn’t...  </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i mean, i didn’t think we were decided on that.</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: i dunno you seemed p set on it</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">He was. What’s bugging him about it is that Roxy didn’t seem to have any suggestions of her own. Rose stops breastfeeding Vriska, and hands her off to Kanaya. She comes to sit beside John, setting a hand on his knee. She speaks kindly.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Wasn’t that the guy from Night Court?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: yeah.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: which was...  </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: A show that reminds you of your father.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: ... </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I think that in this new world we’ve created, it’s important to carry the torch of what we’ve left behind us.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: We must name the next generation for the fallen heroes that we admire.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: wait. we ADMIRE vriska now?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s true that Vriska was a controversial figure even at the best of times, but... </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: She did defeat Lord English, John.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">This remark seems to cure John of his shaky pulse problem, if only because for a moment his heart seems to stop beating altogether. It shocks him in a way that causes him to feel the planet turning under his feet. He whips his head up to look at Rose intently. She seems alert. Her gaze is precise. She doesn’t seem ill, or off, or confused at all.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: no she... didn’t?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: vriska didn’t defeat lord english. </p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: rose, no one knows what happened to lord english.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Of course we do. Vriska used the juju and her accompanying ghost army to defeat him.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Why else would we be here?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i don’t think that’s what actually happened though!</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Then What Did Happen John</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i... i JUST said! </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: no one knows!</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: rose, come on... you’re the one who told me all this!</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I told you what?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: about a year ago. you were feeling bad, and asked me to come over.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: and then you gave me this big speech about canon, and being like, OUTSIDE canon, and NOT canon, and other shit like timelines, and fate and...  </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: and my anime dreams!</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: That’s all in the past, John.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Everything worked out in the end.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Why are you getting so upset about this?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: you gave me a list of instructions and told me that i had to use my retcon powers to go back to a very specific point in time to defeat lord english when he was still just a kid.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: and you told me that i HAD to do this to... to validate the sequence of reality?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: but i didn’t.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i was all ready to go. i... i thought i was going to die, honestly. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: but then YOU...  </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">John swivels around to point a finger at his wife. It comes across as more accusatory than he means it to be.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: roxy, you and calliope told me that i had a choice! </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: and i MADE my choice, which is why i ended up staying.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: but did it really all “work out in the end”?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: if i didn’t stop lord english, then... then... </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: are we even really here at all???</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">The three gals in the room exchange a series of concerned glances. Do they truly think he’s crazy? Are they hiding something from him? John can feel himself trembling. It’s not possible that he’s remembering this wrong, is it? It can’t be. If he presses his eyes shut, he can still see the lines of the black hole cracking space apart around him. It seemed like such a big deal at the time, and then suddenly it felt like nothing at all. Why?</p>
    <p>Roxy leans over and sets a cool hand on John’s forehead.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: u doin ok there babe</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i’m fine!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">You’re the ones not doing okay, he nearly shouts, but then realizes it’s just going to make him sound crazier than he already looks. He brushes Roxy’s hand away and stands abruptly, looking woozy and sweating at the temples. His skin is tight and clammy, too hot and too cold all at once.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: i just... need some fresh air.</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: want me to come with u</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: no!</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i... i mean, no. i need a moment alone. </p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: new dad jitters!</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: haha, that must be it.</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: oh of course that makes sense</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: take care of urself hon</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">John grabs his coat and sprints out of the hive. He vaults into the air and follows the breeze up, coasting over the treeline and out of the troll suburb that Kanaya and Rose have made their home in. Furiously, he begins typing on his phone. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: terezi. i know that you’ve got important stuff to do out there in paradox space, but i really need to hear from you.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: on my side it’s been months since we’ve last talked, and i can’t figure out if it’s because i said something wrong, or... </p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: things here on earth are... </p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: they’re not great.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i mean, on the surface everything is fantastic! everyone’s so happy and it finally seems like we’re all making real progress as adults.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: but at the same time... </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: everyone is also acting crazy!</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i feel like i’m the only sane person left in this entire universe.</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: oh my god, this probably sounds so pathetic.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: terezi, i’m seriously pathetic.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: it’s so selfish of me to even be messaging you at all.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i’ve got a beautiful wife who loves me, but it’s not enough. i can’t even talk to her about what we’re going to name our stupid kid without it turning into some weird thing where she just goes along with whatever i want.</p>

He’s got to pull it together, before he blurts out something really embarrassing. He braces himself, as if splashing an imaginary glass of cold water in his own face, and reminds himself once again that he has a wonderful life. A perfect life. He’s HAPPY, god damn it.  </p>
    <p>He’s about to pocket his phone when he catches some movement at the bottom corner of the screen. It’s an indication that someone is typing.</p>

    <p>She keeps close watch on the political landscape. She’s got people with eyes on every newspaper and website on Earth C, but she likes to watch the human news herself. It’s just such a delightfully adult thing to do, she thinks, as she spreads out languorously in front of her television. She remembers her father doing the same all the time. Well, without the luxurious silk robe and eighty-inch TV screen.</p>

    <p class="jane">JANE: Sigh. Yes, it’s true.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: It’s the same with building laws that are conducive to a functioning, equitable society.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Some people are simply born into positions that confer upon them certain advantages, and it is the job of the government to ensure that people who are less fortunate can be “lifted up,” as it were, to match their luckier peers.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: We must offer greater assistance to some classes of people than others, to ensure that equity.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Such is the case with natural troll and human birth rates.</p>
    <p class="gamzee">GAMZEE: sO yOu SaYiN yOu NeEd DiFfErEnT sHoEs FoR yOuR hUmAn DiCkS aNd WhAt NoT?</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Precisely.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: The reintroduction of the Mother Grub changes everything.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Trolls and humans don’t have identical birth rates. It’s a fundamental biological fact that natural troll reproduction is much faster than humans’.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: It’s a matter of evolution and society!</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: You know this, Gamzee. Your people evolved in a harsh, unforgiving world, where the slightest misstep could lead to death.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: And like any animal would, your biology adapted to the circumstances.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Your Mother Grubs have the capacity to produce an unimaginable quantity of eggs at a time, to ensure that at least a few can survive to reproductive age.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: And I understand that in the context of Alternian society, that worked great. Because the mortality rate was so high, only a manageable number of individuals were able to make it to adulthood.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: But we have a peaceful society now, with benevolent caretakers and fair laws. No young troll is at danger of being killed by monstrous fauna. No one will be culled for being “too weak.”</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: But that doesn’t change your biology.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: So what does that mean for the troll population? It would spiral out of control within a matter of generations!</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: You would come to outnumber humans at a factor of thousands, millions to one. </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: The infrastructure would not be able to keep pace. The economy would be completely destabilized. The market would be flooded with thousands of trolls who wouldn’t be able to find jobs or places to live.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Not to mention the issue of your life spans. Some of you will live for hundreds, thousands of years!</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: And, honestly... speaking of biology... </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: I’m not sure, if we were to loosen population controls right now, that your people have... how to say... </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Well, let’s just say I think it would be irresponsible to gamble on whether or not the natural Alternian order will reassert itself in such a troll-dominated society.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Maybe in a hundred, two hundred years, when you’ve proven—and I believe you will, I really do—but when you’ve proven that you can coexist in a harmonious society with natural breeding, it might not matter so much exactly how many more trolls there are than humans.</p>

Not even someone as willfully loathsome as Makara could be this dense. What’s more likely is he’s attempting to get a rise from her. To get her a little hotter under the collar. To put her in a certain mood.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: I just explained: it’s essential that these regulations remain in place so that the human and troll populations can remain proportionate.</p>

    rooted solely in spurious cultural stereotypes, junk science and knee-jerk bigotry.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: There are objectively real and quantifiable biological and behavioral differences between
    our species, which absolutely must be accounted for if we are to live in a harmonious society

    <p class="no-indent">In spite of Jane’s protests, Gamzee makes a desperate play for a lusty squeeze. Jane puts up a valiant show of resistance, but Gamzee knows she has no real intent of fighting him off—it’s all part of the kismetic dance. He has his big clown mitts right on her busty bags, honking away. </p>
    <p>As soon as Jane starts screaming, the baby does too. Jake, sitting approximately six feet away, bounces the infant a little to calm him down.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: I say would you mind keeping it down for tavros?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: He was sleeping and to be honest i think things here are getting a little blue for a baby.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jane and Gamzee break apart at once. It’s like she’d forgotten that Jake was there at all—she scrambles to cover herself properly the moment his voice cuts through the din of sloppy, moist honking. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Jake! Darling.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Don’t worry. Th-there’s plenty of attention to go around, my love.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Would you care to join us?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Erm its ok i think its time for tavros to be fed anyway. Why dont i just take a bottle and get him out of here so you two can... </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Oh, yes, yes. Gamzee, get him a bottle, won’t you?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake, who had been sitting on the other side of the couch with sweet baby Tavros in his arms, remains stiff with his squalling infant as he waits for Gamzee to carry out his commanded task. The clown bends over revoltingly in front of the couch, full rump straining against his plush purple briefs, as if daring Jake to look away—and he can’t. Jake stares transfixed into the full moon of the clown’s buttocks, appearing virtually shrink-wrapped by the moist fabric, as Gamzee slowly descends, fingers trailing down the entire length of his leg. His codpiece bobs between his spread thighs as he grasps the bottle of milk that had been knocked to the ground in the fracas. Then he snaps right back up with a honk that nearly makes Jake rocket out of his seat. </p>
    <p>Jake’s heart is racing so hard he loses focus. He doesn’t notice that Gamzee is offering him the bottle until Jane’s angry voice wrenches him back to his senses.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Gamzee! That’s been on the ground! Get him a clean one.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Gamzee shrugs, and squirrels away the half-spilled bottle in his codpiece. He walks off and returns with a fresh bottle from the fridge, then hands it over to Jake. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Haha thanks ill just be going now. See ya. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake snatches the bottle from Gamzee’s hand and all but flees the room in as brisk a walk as he can manage. Baby Tavros calms down as soon as the rubber nipple is in his mouth. </p>
    <p>But no matter how far Jake walks down the long corridors of Jane’s mansion, the lascivious honks echo through the halls like the wails of a dolorous ghost. Nowhere is truly safe. Every little noise emanating from that cursed living room shoots through Jake’s skull like a gunshot.</p>
    <p>As Jake gently bounces the baby in one arm, he takes out his phone to text an old friend.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Jade are you there?</p>

    <p>The sound of his wife’s rapturous howling unmoors the last of Jake’s composure. He staggers, threatening to spill soft little Tavros on his soft little head, killing him forever. It’s not safe to stand. So Jake shuts himself into the first empty room he comes across and lets himself slide to the ground against the closed door.</p>

    <p class="jade">JADE: i guess not</p>
    <p class="jade">JADE: but i dont think any of us are really interested in having a kid with ectobiology</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Jade rolls over and nuzzles herself into the crook of Dave’s armpit, taking Karkat’s hand with her so that it’s slung over her stomach. Dave doesn’t stop scrolling on his phone. His face is a kaleidoscope of neon, lit from beneath by the Alternian mushrooms that flare up at night with a sick, green bioluminescence, and from above by the soft glow of his social media accounts.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Karkat, lazily munching on a chocolate beetle, taps his foot against the picnic blanket. Jade moves his hand so that it’s resting subtly on the line of exposed skin above her skirt, where her tank top is riding up. He seems not to notice. Instead, he’s seriously considering Dave’s question. He picks a leg off one of his beetles and flicks it over Jade so that it lands on Dave’s forehead.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Jade pokes a finger into Dave’s chin, sliding it up his jawline so that it puckers his mouth into a pout. It’s a pretty cute thing to do, if extremely immature. This might be the point Dave was trying to make, that they’re all still kind of immature. Jade doesn’t pick up on the obvious subtext in the conversation, however, because she’s been willfully undermining the subtext in her own personal life for nearly a year now.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">She takes in a shaky breath and shuts her eyes. Her hair spills around her face when she leans forward to put her chin on her knees. Dave and Karkat exchange a look that is equal parts confused, miserable, and desperate. Karkat’s making a fist against the ground, digging up a handful of moss and getting dirt under his fingernails. Perhaps it’s a metaphor, he wryly speculates, for the way Jade has just dug up the emotional dirt in their relationship. Dave clears his throat quietly. One of them could say something right now if they found the nerve. But as the moments slide by, nerve remains in short supply.</p>
    <p>Karkat opens his mouth, without quite having settled on the words that will come out of it. But before any do, the sky cracks open. Instead, he lets out an undignified yelp and scuttles back so he doesn’t get hit by the sharp debris suddenly raining from above.</p>
    <p>Jade spins around and flings her arms out, using her Space powers to catch the offensive rubble and shrink it into harmless granules. They spark and clash against her fingers. She can’t quite tell what they are. They’re not rocks, or metal... they don’t even seem to be physical. </p>
    <p>Something else comes hurtling out of the hole in the sky, too fast for Jade to catch. It hits the ground with a clap of green lightning. The collision sends a geyser of dirt, rock, and vapor into the air. Dave flash-steps to shield Karkat. Jade doesn’t move, taking the brunt of the explosion face on, using her abilities to warp the energy around her so that she’s a mote at the center of the storm. When the dust clears, she’s the first to jump in the crater, trailing smoke behind her.</p>
    <p>There’s a body at the center of it. The torso is bloody, tangled, and curled into a fetal position. Its shoes are missing, but otherwise the outfit is quite familiar to her: it’s a dead ringer for her old Witch of Space uniform. Jade touches the body with the toe of her shoe, and then gasps when it rolls over to reveal its face.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Jade doesn’t say anything. She’s staring at the body. A badly broken version of herself, probably from a different timeline, she guesses. This Jade looks about sixteen years old. Her hair is matted with blood. Her appearance is gruesome, yet also... peaceful, somehow. </p>
    <p>Dave slides down the ridge of the crater and grabs her by the shoulder.</p>

As the name of the land would imply, the planet’s surface is covered in tombs, each an ancient skyscraper piercing the brilliant, gaseous thunderclouds above. But there’s only one tomb he’s come for. A simple, household refrigerator, just like the one he grew up with. </p>
    <p>He pops into canon at one end of a rooftop, up so high that the chemical storm coursing through the atmosphere sets his hair on edge. At the other end of the roof are Dirk and Dave, doing something he never thought he’d see: they’re... <em>hugging</em>. Not just regular, noncommittal hugging. They are emphatically hugging the <em>shit</em> out of each other. Dave’s face is buried in Dirk’s side, and Dirk’s got both arms around him in a way that looks like he’s never actually hugged another human being before.</p>
    <p>Sensing that this is probably something he shouldn’t be seeing, he tiptoes towards Gamzee’s would-be sarcophagus as carefully and quietly as he can, and places his hands just above the thick aluminum hull. The moment John’s palms hit the fridge, Dirk turns to look at him. His head only moves an inch. Slowly, he lowers one eyebrow and returns to his poignant and deeply personal business with Dave, as if he hasn’t observed anything worth acknowledging at all. </p>
    <p>Which, John supposes, is for the best? He isn’t trying to mess up the timeline any more than he needs to. He’s only here to steal a refrigerator that has recently been used to entomb a clown. He has enough on his plate with this idiotic heist as it is. </p>
    <p>Anyway, he decides to mind his own damn business and get this fridge back to Earth C. He zaps himself and the fridge back to the same picnic grounds he departed from, while cleverly leaving the chains wrapping the fridge behind on LOTAK. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">With the same delicacy that he’d use to touch a toilet bowl in a public bathroom, he grabs the handle of the fridge and pulls.</p>
    <p>Gamzee pops out immediately, sweating, gasping for breath, and smelling like socks that have been worn continuously for two weeks straight. John rears back and pinches his nose shut. Calliope shoots John a sharp look, like a stern teacher would.</p>

    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WOW, SURE FEELS WEIRD TO JUST BE HANGING OUT WITH ALL THESE ASSHOLES WE WERE TOTALLY GOSSIPING ABOUT JUST TWENTY MINUTES AGO. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Karkat is loudly whispering to Dave, leaning a bit too intimately into the curve of his chest for two dudes who are dating the same girl, but not each other.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i always knew our gossip sins would catch up with us eventually</p>
    <p class="jade">JADE: SHH both of you!!!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jade brushes past them holding her dead teen-self under the armpits, while Jake brings up the rear, stripe-tighted ankles in hand. He shoots Dave and Karkat a big, toothy grin. Dave nods back. Karkat continues to look somewhat seasick, keeping his eyes high so that they don’t accidentally graze teen-Jade’s impaled chest. </p>
    <p>Jake and Jade take the corpse up the winding, white staircase toward Jane’s bedchamber. The Crocker mansion is a dazzling maze of marble halls polished to a mirror sheen. It’s the kind of place where footsteps echo from one end of a floor to the other, and even the pillows are lined with literal silver thread. There’s a peaked skylight at the top of the foyer that splits the morning sun like a prism, spilling multicolored dots across every surface below. Amongst those dots are drips of teen-Jade’s blood. It’s so dark on the spotless tile that it looks nearly black.</p>
    <p>Dave stays with Karkat by the door. They’re waiting to meet Rose, Kanaya, John, and an extremely pregnant Roxy, who all show up together with baby Vriska, who’s really been coming along in her metamorphosis cycle lately. She now has both aural cavities and opposable thumbs, and she’s making good use of the latter by reaching out to mash her hands against the face of any adult foolish enough to enter her range. She grabs one of Karkat’s little nubby horns when Kanaya passes by. He reacts pretty much the same way he would if it were actual-Vriska tugging on any part of his person. He flails and grouses, making a few strangled sounds of impotent rage. It gives everyone a good giggle on a dark and confusing day.</p>

John is a pallbearer this time around. Teen-Jade is so light, he and Jake alone carry the coffin with ease. Together, they trudge through the ankle-deep puddles while their friends line up on either side of the stone steps that lead into the cathedral.</p>
    <p>It’s just them this time—Earth C’s very own dysfunctional collection of Old Gods. John can’t say he misses the clangor of a shameless press hounding them from the edges of what is supposed to be a somber ceremony. But the smallness of the congregation under the tall, gothic ceilings makes Roxy’s attitude at the pulpit all the more absurd. She leads John and Jake into the building and down the center of the nave, humming happily to herself the entire time. An equally effusive Calliope trails behind her, carrying a bouquet of purple flowers. Despite Roxy’s insistence that this sad event could only bring them all closer together, the group is sitting in chilly segments on either side of aisle, pointedly not interacting. Karkat is sitting all on his own about six pews behind Jade and Dave. Gamzee is hanging out by the door, having been banished there by Jane like a wet dog. No one in the cathedral can blame her, because he certainly smells like one.</p>
    <p>Roxy, bathed in pink and gold light from the stained glass behind her, spreads her arms and begins to speechify. She practically has to shout to be heard over the roar of the rainstorm outside.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: thx everyone for joining us today</p>

    <p class="roxy">ROXY: by which i mean we didnt know her at all</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: cuz she fell out of the sky like a week ago and was already dead</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: but i think that based on our long acquaintanceship with alive jade we can safely assume that she was totally rad</p>
    <p class="jade">JADE: (ugh)</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: so were all here to contemplate the vast cruelness of the universe that such radness was plucked in its prime</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Calliope begins plucking the petals off her bouquet and tossing them in a fluttery, uneven arc over Roxy’s impressively coiffed hair.</p>
    <p>John facepalms audibly in the crowd. He’d spent the entire morning giving one more go at talking Roxy out of the entire affair, but she was stubbornly dedicated to her artistic vision. You gave it the old college try chap, Jake said to him earlier as he waxed his mustache in the mirror. But its better for a man to just let his wife do whatever she wants. I promise youll experience less pain that way old boy.</p>

    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: the combination of red and blUe in this context is meant to evoke the dUal natUre of death, in that there is nothing more mysterioUs and impossible to comprehend than the vast void of the afterlife, bUt also there is nothing that makes Us appreciate the life and and love that we already have than the mystery of death.</p>
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: while death is terrifying, there is always joy to be foUnd among the sorrow. each time we witness death, we fall in love with the important people in oUr lives all over again.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Calliope is gazing at Roxy with glassy eyes. She sniffs as she plucks the last petal from her rose. A breeze washes through the cathedral from the crack in the door at the end of the room, brushing the petal off-course and causing it to get stuck in Roxy’s over-sprayed hair. Calliope reaches out with a visibly shaking hand to remove the plant offal, but she does not draw back. Instead, she lets her hand graze down the side of Roxy’s face and cup her cheek. Roxy puts her own hand over Callie’s and holds it.</p>
    <p>John tilts his head and squints at the image in front of him. Hmm.</p>

    <p>Everyone whips their heads around to see, of all people, Aradia hovering in the foyer. Her wings radiate a soft, ephemeral glow that paints the walls around her pink and red. Sollux is with her, feeling his way into the church along the grain of the door. He’s soaked head to toe.</p>

The noise reverberates through the entire cathedral, shaking dust off of the unused pews and rattling the iron in the stained-glass windows. Outside, a clap of thunder follows.</p>
    <p>Aradia vaults into the air and flits over the pews to get a better look at the body. Teen-Jade remains in the bloody Space outfit she crashed to Earth in, since nobody was willing to dislodge the huge, otherworldly shard from her chest in order to change her. But Roxy has done the corpse’s makeup beautifully, and fashioned her a lovely flower crown. If not for all the blood caked down her front, and her conspicuous impalement, she’d look like she was merely sleeping.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">John swoops his wife up in his arms and starts scrambling down the aisle. </p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Calliope begins sprinting after John and Roxy but doesn’t make it two steps before something stops her in her tracks. A feeling that crawls under her exoskeleton. She stands deathly still for a moment, and then turns to face the coffin. Something about the corpse has transfixed her. She curls her fingers around the rim of the casket and leans in, studying teen-Jade’s peaceful face.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, the corpse bolts upright. Calliope yelps and falls on her butt. Adult-Jade screams. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jade">JADE: AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: jesus fuck</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Hair veiling her face, teen-Jade sets her hands on her chest and dissolves the shard bisecting her ribcage. The wound does not heal, but it doesn’t bleed either.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: jade! yoU...  </p>

    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: yoU’re not dead!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">It takes the corpse a while to reply. Everyone waits for her to speak. When the words leave her mouth, they send a chill through the cathedral air. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: i am not jade.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Slowly, Jade raises her head. The stage makeup Roxy applied earlier is running down her face in dark rivers. Her eyes are solid black. Even more than black, it seems. They are hollows penetrating deep into a field of absence so profound, it’s hard to imagine a single photon has ever crossed through its infinite expanse. Meeting her gaze is like peering into a realm where light goes to die. Calliope finds the sensation disturbingly familiar.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: then who...  </p>
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: who are yoU?</p>

    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: we met once, years ago.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: you were dead, and so was i.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Calliope now understands exactly who is speaking to her. She tenses up, scuttles backward, and begins tumbling down the stairs into the aisle. She starts running before she’s even up on both feet, clawing the carpet ragged in her desperation to escape the cathedral. The congregation watches her go, but no one moves to help her, or even looks in her direction. In her wake, she leaves a primal, echoing wail. The door closes thunderously behind her. Her scream can be heard beyond the doors, growing quieter as she recedes into the distance.</p>
    <p>Kanaya adjusts the buttons on her very fashionable mourning gloves and sighs.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Teen-Jade floats out of her coffin with measured grace. Adult-Jade shudders as her reanimated duplicate passes by. She slides back into Kanaya’s comforting arms and hides her face in the crook of her neck. Teen-Jade directs her pitch-black eyes toward the arched marble ceiling, and gazes skyward with a sort of intensity and purpose nobody in this crowd has seen in years. It’s as if her glare is passing through the roof of the church and continuing unimpeded through the partitions of this very plane of reality itself. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: you’re undoubtedly surprised.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">She directs the powerful vacuum of her hollow glare towards the total idiot. She regards him for a moment, radiating a sense of disdain for what may very well be the greatest living source of ignorance she has ever encountered in her many eons of existence.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Terezi doesn’t answer, which is what John was expecting. He frowns and pockets his phone, blinking at the sudden brightness above him. The sky is ripped open in a dozen places, spilling ghosts and razor shards of unreality. John shields his face against the neon glare and scans the park for his family. Roxy and Calliope usually come listen to Gamzee preach, and John’s long since grown tired of trying to talk them out of it. The best he can do at this point is tag along to make sure that young Harry Anderson isn’t hearing all this utter nonsense without the tempering influence of his skeptical father. It’s the responsible, adult thing to do. </p>
    <p>Well, it would be the responsible, adult thing to do if John were actually doing it. Instead, he just spent the last ten minutes surreptitiously texting Terezi under the hem of his suit jacket. Now he’s lost track of his wife, his son, and his wife’s sort-of-ex-girlfriend in the enraptured throng of all these brainless clown worshippers. The crowd is mostly ghosts, but there’s a substantial number of carapacian and human citizens out here tonight as well, straining to get a good look at the newly “redeemed” acolytes. </p>
    <p>John’s eye wanders toward the center of the crowd’s focus. Looks like a conversion is taking place right now.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">John makes a disgusted face as Gamzee grabs the two trolls by a horn each and mashes their faces together. One of them looks extremely into it. The other... not so much.

    <p class="no-indent">John puts his phone away quickly. Roxy’s holding Harry Anderson up on her shoulder. John can see his son’s face, grinning and bright-eyed, bobbing above the crowd. He returns the smile and starts to make his way toward his wife.</p>
    <p>Just then, a dark shadow passes over the park. The crowd falls silent as they raise their heads to watch a drone ship pass by overhead. Its design is insect-like, splitting into many jagged branches, each decked out with weapons and cameras. It’s completely silent, and encased in armor with a bright red finish, smooth and seamless. It’s often cited by Jane as the crown jewel of Crockercorp’s various military contracts with the government. </p>
    <p>John reunites with his family and takes Harry Anderson from Roxy. The toddler buries his face in John’s chest to escape the horrible sight crawling across the sky above them. Calliope clasps her hands together and stares at the ship with a terse expression. </p>

    <p class="no-indent">That night, after he and Roxy put Harry Anderson to bed and Roxy retires to their room for the evening, John goes to his office and prints out the picture of Terezi. He doesn’t have any nice photo paper to put it on, so it comes out too dark with the colors all smeared. He scrubs the printer history settings when he’s finished.</p>
    <p>When his anxiety is assuaged, he flops down in the spinny chair at the center of the room and studies the picture. Terezi doesn’t look that much different from how he remembers her—a little more worn, maybe, thinner and older and more tired, but it’s her. She’s smiling, and holding up her hand in a cheeky wave that suggests neither a greeting or a farewell. The light from the phone screen is reflected in her glasses. John can’t see her eyes.</p>
    <p>He folds the picture into quarters and slips it into his wallet, behind Harry Anderson’s baby photo. Then he turns off the light and goes to bed.</p></div>

    \ sweetheart... give me a second!</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"no-indent\">John finishes\
    \ fixing his tie in the bedroom mirror, taking a moment to check the hallway door\
    \ in the reflection. Roxy hasn’t come looking for him, which is good because he’s\
    \ still got a few things to prepare and he’d rather she didn’t see the items he’s\
    \ about to pull out of their closet. </p>\n<p>He hasn’t told his wife what he’s\
    \ planning, because he doesn’t want to be talked out of it. Typically he rankles\
    \ at the prospect of spending time with Jane and her family. So Roxy was surprised\
    \ when he agreed to hold Harry Anderson’s fifth birthday party at Jane’s mansion.\
    \ But she didn’t question him about it. In fact, all she did was tip her head\
    \ at him and blink a few times, her long eyelashes catching the light, making\
    \ her eyes look like mirrors. It was disconcerting for reasons that he couldn’t\
    \ put his finger on. It’s not like Roxy had ever been argumentative, exactly.\
    \ He just seems to remember someone from his youth who was somewhat more contrarian\
    \ in spirit than this person he’s married to now. </p>\n<p>Back when they were\
    \ dating, John thought she was acting a little off. Not quite in a bad way, but\
    \ perhaps a little too “in love,” too fast. At least she still seemed like herself\
    \ most of the time. But since the wedding, every year that goes by, she seems\
    \ to become just a little more conciliatory. Not just toward him but toward life\
    \ in general. She indulges Harry Anderson liberally and almost thoughtlessly.\
    \ She doesn’t care that her best friend is slowly turning into an executive overseeing\
    \ the corporate arm up the puppet ass of a ruthless dictatorship. She still thinks\
    \ Gamzee is being sincere about all this “redemption” bullshit, even though he’s\
    \ been casting an increasingly dark and hungry shadow behind Jane: a malicious\
    \ royal vizier to her burgeoning imperial persona. John’s been frustrated with\
    \ it in a quiet, guilty way, because he loves his wife. And even more than that,\
    \ he loves their son. When he doesn’t think too hard about all this stuff, it\
    \ seems perfect. </p>\n<p>But sometimes John can’t help but lie awake at night,\
    \ staring at the dark ceiling until he loses the grip on his “perfect life” entirely.\
    \ He starts to fear that if he closes his eyes, he might reopen them to discover\
    \ it was all an illusion: Harry Anderson, Earth C, Lord English’s alleged “defeat”...\
    \ or maybe, stretching even further back than that. The trolls, the game, everything\
    \ important and exciting that’s ever happened to him. Was it all a lie? Like some\
    \ big prank?</p>\n<p>No... at least some of it had to be real. Dave, Jade, and\
    \ Rose are real. Their friendship is real. At least, it used to feel that way.\
    \ He needs to believe it still is. And what about Terezi? She’s real too, and\
    \ John’s got that picture to prove it, burning a hole in his wallet. Yet he keeps\
    \ it there, because at least that feels like something. It’s the same feeling\
    \ that makes him do subtle things to push against his wife’s placid demeanor.\
    \ He never quite tries to start a fight. But at this point, he wouldn’t mind having\
    \ one either. At least it might help reassure him that she’s real too. </p>\n\
    <p>If she doesn’t get upset after what he’s about to pull today, then...  </p>\n\
    <p>John doesn’t know what he’ll do.</p>\n<p>He goes to the closet and unhinges\
    \ the bottom of the drawer where he keeps all of his identical blue ties. In this\
    \ secret compartment are some tools: graphene wire, a multi-tool screwdriver,\
    \ molding plaster... John’s so focused on finding places in his coat to hide all\
    \ these things that he doesn’t hear footsteps behind him.</p>\n<div class=\"chat\

    <p class=\"no-indent\">Tavros takes in a sharp breath before spinning on his heel\
    \ and stumbling toward his closet. John catches the ghost of a smile on his face\
    \ before he turns and that’s all it takes to turn the pounding of his heart from\
    \ terrified to thrilled. Yes, what he’s about to do will probably send shock waves\
    \ through their already fragmented friend group. But Jane’s the one who started\
    \ it. She brought this on herself.</p>\n<p>John starts opening the window, using\
    \ all the tricks he’s memorized from tutorials on the deep web to bypass the security\
    \ bolt. He whistles to himself, thinking about how happy Tavros is going to be\
    \ with him, Roxy, and Harry Anderson. Jane barely even seems to like the kid.\
    \ But Jake does. Jake loves him, even though he was totally trapped into this\
    \ unhappy relationship because of the pregnancy. So it seems to John the only\
    \ way to save Jake from this unspeakable prison is to subtract the only thing\
    \ he cares about. </p>\n<p>Roxy will be mad at first, but John is certain that\
    \ she’ll... she’ll what? Acquiesce? Is that really what he wants? He considers\
    \ with a sense of guilt how exhilarating it would it be if she finally fought\
    \ him on something. John starts laughing to himself when the window pops open\
    \ suddenly. No alarm goes off. The deep web was right. </p>\n<p>Fresh summer air\
    \ rushes in and fills John’s lungs. His head swims with the giddy, high feeling\
    \ of being on the verge of getting away with some shit. Wow, is this why people\
    \ commit crimes? It feels so good. He can’t wait to tell Terezi that he’s done\
    \ something so BOLD and 1LL3G4L. He starts laughing louder. Tavros is laughing\
    \ too, quiet and cautious at first, but picking up steam as he begins to taste\
    \ the sort of freedom he never allowed himself to imagine.</p>\n<p>John turns,\
    \ shocked to see Jade standing in the bedroom doorway. She looks like a shadow\
    \ with her dark hair hiding her face. John can’t tell what kind of expression\
    \ she’s making under there. She speaks softly.</p>\n<div class=\"chat type-rg\

    <p class="no-indent">Aradia throws her legs over the edge of the ancient meteor facility and kicks them out into open space. Far below her feet, the meteor is wildly overgrown. It landed here millions of years ago, after its fateful three-year journey when it hosted several trolls and humans as they had a variety of critical coming-of-age experiences. It will stay here for millions more years, where it will remain indefinitely on a barren, desolate Earth C, waiting to host a single cherub child, chained to its bedroom. But for now, it hosts these three. </p>
    <p>Dead-Jade, whose body also happens to be hosting a cherub at the moment, is doing the same thing she does every day: sitting with her legs crossed and her eyes closed, using her still-teenage body to scry into the abyss. The light from the outer rim of the stratosphere casts her face in powdery blue light. It’s certainly a more becoming avatar for Calliope, most would find. The Calliope who Roxy calls a friend, in her moments of greatest self-reproach, would die for a body like this. The version of Calliope who’s been dead for eons, however, waiting for exactly this moment in history to reinstate her corporeal presence, couldn’t care less about her host’s appearance. It is simply serving as a functional vessel for the crucial role she now must play. </p>

    <p class="no-indent">Karkat winces as the ground above him shakes and a scattering of dirt and debris rains down from the roof of the cave. His fledgling rebellion has found cover in the spiderweb network of tunnels running to and from the troll capital originally built to accommodate the transit of incestuous slurry from the boonies to the Mother Grub. Though technically regarded as a critical infrastructure project, the caves have never been used or appropriately surveyed by the world government. Back when all were on better terms, Jane was gracious enough to believe the maps Kanaya handed over were anything approaching accurate. With the tunnel entrances at the brood pit sealed, the rebellion was safe for now. But the presidential drones were testing the grounds relentlessly: closer and closer every day now.</p>
    <p>It’s not the dirt that’s bothering him. Dirt is something you get used to, living hand-to-mouth inside a cave. It’s that persistent fucking leak directly above his desk that is driving him to distraction.</p>

The fact that he is shackled at the wrists doesn’t seem to be helping.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">He stalks past his blushing assistant with a belabored sigh. Karkat has lived with humans for so long that he’s grown used to seeing buckets regularly defiled. Now that he thinks about it, he realizes Jade has used more buckets to grow snap peas in her living room than any troll has used for the purposes of reproduction in the entire history of Earth C. The bucket taboo is largely emblematic at this point. An empty signifier for an endangered culture.</p>
    <p>As he stomps through the winding tunnels, thinking very hard about this incredibly tragic thing, his speaker crab crackles to life.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Karkat makes extra-triple sure that he’s actually hung up on Kanaya for real this time, by fiddling with the tiny claw on his speaker crab until it’s in the off position. The action of tuning his outdated wristwatch is interrupted by another earthquake rumbling around him. This one sounds different, however. He knows the sound of a drone strike like the back of his hand by now. It’s a low, creeping bellow that pulses through the ground in waves. This sounds more like an impact that left a crater. The last time something struck the planet that hard, it was Jade’s creepy undead corpse.</p>
    <p>Karkat runs for the nearest exit and cautiously pokes his head out into the clearing above. There’s a figure in the smoke: her stumbling silhouette includes an unmistakable pair of horns. She takes two steps out of her crater before falling flat on her face again. Karkat runs to help her, putting her arm over his shoulders and dragging her out of the dust cloud from the impact.</p>

He realizes he’s not dwelling so much on the content he’s hesitating to send—which now that he’s looking at it, seems no less vapid than anything he tends to bother Terezi with online—as he is on the nature of this correspondence they have, and his peculiar semiannual need to bother her in this way at all. What is this relationship they have, he wonders? Does he even care that much? Does she?</p>
    <p>But if he doesn’t care that much, and there’s nothing to it, then why does he do it? Why does he seem to put care into the nonsense he badgers her with? He supposes he could ask the same of many features of his life. Why does he care? Why does he put the time in? When you can’t shake the feeling that nothing here has much intrinsic meaning—or rings as “canon,” to drop a term he has to admit has worn out some welcome in his vocabulary—how does one justify even leaving the house?</p>
    <p>He thought he was over this. That he got his moping out of his system those first few years on Earth C and then started getting his life on track. He got married, he had a kid. That fixes everything, right? He wonders if his intermittent check-ins with Terezi have less to do with her personally and more to do with gravitating toward someone who’s still out there. Someone who can still lay credible claim to functioning as an agent of relevance. A person who hasn’t entirely forfeited their volitional integrity just yet. Like a guy with a wife and a kid.</p>
    <p>Heh, not a bad joke he just told himself, he has to admit. But it’s not satisfying, because it’s probably not the answer. The truth is, he thinks he just keeps texting Terezi because she’s the only one he knows who isn’t here.</p>
    <p>John drifts aimlessly through the atmosphere for hours, thinking, but not thinking. The forest below grows thin, alien. He floats past the border of the Troll Kingdom, where the grass starts to get sparse and gray, and sets down in a quarry surrounded by bare, thorny bushes. Instead of flowers they’re sprouting throbbing yellow pustules. John touches a branch and one of the pustules bursts, leaking mustard-colored slime everywhere. How could you be homesick for a place like this, John wonders.</p>
    <p>Then he remembers Terezi once told him about the place she grew up in. A quiet forest of blueberry and cotton candy. A canopy so dense she had to walk minutes from her house to be exposed to the sun. Even Alternia had beauty in it. But John is sure that Earth C probably replicates it the same way it replicates everything else: thin and garish and fake, fake, fakity FAKE. A bad photocopy with the ink settings turned to high contrast. A sunrise that casts no shadows.</p>
    <p>He’s been contemplating this melodramatically for maybe ten minutes when the sky rips opens above him and flashes violent waves of red and green across the landscape. Having dead trolls deposited from the sky like this is far from unusual these days, but what comes plummeting out of the rips in space above this time isn’t troll-shaped at all. It looks more like a meteor—a flash of metal and fire screaming toward the planet, trailing thick black smoke behind it. It outpaces the flames for a moment, and John recognizes it. It can’t be. There’s no way. And yet, there’s no mistaking it.</p>
    <p>It’s his father’s car. A whole ton of white metal oxidizing in the heat, the windows all smashed open. If anyone’s in there, he can’t make them out. John feels like he watches the car descend and crash against the earth in slow motion. It hits the ground with an impact that reverberates for miles. </p>
    <p>He’s never moved so fast as he does to reach the crater. He skids to a stop at the rim: below, the car is twisted and steaming, curled into horrible, jagged edges, but the back half is mostly intact. He sends a thrust of wind through the back of the carriage to blow both doors off and crawls inside to examine the seats. Just to make absolutely certain no one was in it when it crashed. The metal of the frame is still so hot that the air around it is sizzling, but John doesn’t care.</p>
    <p>The back seat is a mess. It’s smeared with... shaving cream? With little bits of... something, strewn about. He pinches some of the dry, brown, flaky substance, and sniffs it. Is this... tobacco?</p>
    <p>Mingling with the shaving cream, there are red bloodstains. But no flesh, or bones, or anything signifying the remains of a person. John puts a hand to his chest and sighs with... relief? Disappointment? He has no idea what he was hoping to find in here. Not his father, right? That would be stupid. Who needs to put eyes on their own father’s corpse twice in one lifetime. But then, he sees it.</p>
    <p>A streak of teal, smudged along the top ridge of the seat cushion, at the center of a red, bloody handprint. With wide eyes, John reaches out and runs his thumb over it. It chips under his nail, the same consistency as human blood. The same color as Terezi’s text.</p>
    <p>He rubs the flaky crust between his fingers. He only stopped talking to her a few hours ago. Time passes differently out there, as he’s often reminded. She was so sure she was dying. Was this it? Was this how she —</p>
    <p>John reels back, nausea striking him in the pit of his stomach. What kind of twisted coincidence is this? Why is he finding this now? If Terezi was here, why? Who was she bleeding with in the back of his father’s car?</p>
    <p>It finally hits him. Not just that he hasn’t seen Terezi in years, or that he’s never going to see her again. It’s that he never <em>was</em> going to see her again. It was over before it began. </p>
    <p>John’s body is drenched in sweat. He staggers away from the mangled car, his eyes stinging from the heat. He rips his glasses off and looks up at the sky, an unfocused and unspecific field of color and possibility. It looks like a flat canvas to him, yet behind its flatness he knows it stretches back through an infinite expanse of pointlessness, a limitless field of uncaring. It seems to mock him. </p>
    <p>He points his eyes at the sympathetic dirt instead. The soft earth seems to beckon him, and he finds himself sinking to his knees, fingers digging into the disrupted soil. It’s still warm, humming with energy from the car’s meteoric fall. The sight of his arms stretched out in front of him warps in his blurry field of vision, bending and shimmering in the dying light.</p>
    <p>John realizes he’s crying when the first wet droplets fall onto the backs of his hands. They mingle with the dirt around him, turning the comforting earth to sticky mud. He doesn’t get it, and he never has. </p>
    <p>A choked sob forces its way out of his chest. His fingers flex into claws, gathering up dirt into his shaking fists. He bears down until his knuckles turn white and his fingernails press sharply into the flesh of his palms. The pain makes him feel real.</p>
    <p>All he’s ever wanted is to be fucking real.</p>
    <p>Then, as if not quite finished with the sky just yet, he turns his gaze upward to give it one last angry look. He feels consumed in that moment by the acuteness of his physicality and the overwhelming scale of his cosmic irrelevance. His lungs fill with air, and he releases all his years of pent-up frustration and anger and guilt and doubt and weakness and pain and misery in a blood-curdling shout that sounds more like it’s from the mouth of an animal than a man. John screams at the merciless sky until his throat is raw and he has no energy left even to cry. </p>
    <p>No one hears him, and if they had, it wouldn’t matter.</p></div>

    <p>Two minutes before midnight, a teenage boy crosses beneath the neon lights of the Trollish slums, stepping quick and sure-footed atop the cracked pavement as if this is a path he’s walked many times. He’s got on a coat two sizes too big and a brimmed hat pulled down to hide his distinctive buck-toothed grin. Above him, Jane Crocker’s face beams out from a holographic propaganda display, reminding the populace that curfew is in fifteen minutes.</p>
    <p>This boy would like to say that he’s too cool and daring to care about curfew, but the sound of Jane’s cloying, prerecorded voice rising above the noisy streets sends an involuntary shiver down his spine. Luckily, the girl he’s come to meet does not suffer from the same instinctive Jane-based anxiety. She doesn’t have many fears or inhibitions at all. About a block from where they usually meet, she swings out of an alleyway and yanks him in by his elbow. He lets loose a shrill, unmasculine noise right into her mouth before she shuts him up with a kiss.</p>
    <p>After a few minutes of extremely novice make-out action, Harry Anderson and Vriska part, both wet-mouthed and short of breath. Harry Anderson wipes a bit of blood off of his bottom lip. Vriska pokes him in the chest and hisses.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="no-indent">Harry Anderson rolls his eyes. He has beautiful eyes. He’s a pretty successful combination of his parents’ genes, all things considered. He’s got his father’s infectious grin, his mother’s long eyelashes, and his “auntie’s” unusually blue eyes.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Vriska doubles over laughing at Harry Anderson’s impressively spot-on imitation of Gamzee’s mulish lilt and vaguely lewd posture. Harry Anderson starts giggling too. He can’t help it. She’s so pretty and her laugh is both cruel and infectious.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Aradia lies with her chin in her palms and looks over the edge of the meteor station. Under the shade of night, the cities of the Troll Kingdom form a twinkling filigree over the rocky landscape below, a hundred rivers of gossamer lights in all the colors of the hemospectrum. Jane’s fleet is so massive that it blots out the lights of the capital. Is this what Alternia looked like from the sky as well? Aradia lived far from the city, and that all seems so long ago anyway. Sollux comes to stand by her, popping open a can of fizzy drink.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">On Earth C, months go by at a breakneck pace. Teens fall in and out of love and hate. Alliances change, revolutions fully germinate, wars commence. And somewhere within that mess, John Egbert is the best man at Jade and Dave’s wedding. He lasts nearly two hours before he gets a ruinous case of the sniffles.</p>
    <p>The event is being held semi-clandestinely in the mansion of one of Jake’s wealthy television exec friends, staged as a “reunion party” for whichever one of his old, stupid television shows people get nostalgic about these days. It’s a smokescreen meant to throw the human government off the scent of political radicals like Rose and Kanaya partying just twenty miles from the seat of power. Jake claims there’s no way they’ll find them, but John sometimes gets the feeling that the whole planet’s bugged. After nearly ten years of unfettered monetary interference in the upper echelons of the global hegemony, could something like this possibly fly under Jane’s radar? It can’t, right? John likes to think she’s not so far gone that she’d tip off the government to send troops to arrest her friends and family on the occasion of her ecto-daughter’s wedding. </p>
    <p>So he smiles his way through his best man duties, then smiles his way again through the gallows-humor speech Rose gives at dinner, backlit by the flames of the Imperial Drone factories churning away on the horizon. He wears a possibly genuine expression for a few moments as he dips down to give Jade a kiss on the forehead. She looks beautiful in her dress, and Dave doesn’t look especially uncomfortable beside her. There is still joy to be found on the eve of a war, Rose says in her speech, but John found precious little to be happy about in this world even before everything went off the fucking chain. He is conspicuously unaccompanied. Not alone, of course: he’s been put in a honored seat at the head of the wedding party with Jade to his left and Rose to his right. But Jade is with Dave, and Rose has Kanaya and their daughter, and everyone knows that John has lost his family to Jane Crocker.</p>
    <p>Well, not literally to Jane Crocker. What drove Roxy away was him being depressed and just an all-around huge wet blanket who was impossible to live with. John is totally ready to own the fact that he was a bad husband, but maybe not the fact that he was a bad enough husband to drive his wife to passively support a brewing genocidal dictatorship. She looks happier, though, whenever he’s caught sight of her behind Jane—Calliope faithfully at her side—in any of the propaganda broadcasts that Jane passes off as business press conferences. By the time Roxy finally cut things off between them, he hadn’t personally seen her smile in years.</p>
    <p>John has no idea how Harry Anderson is doing, but he definitely caught Vriska texting him under the table when he got up to get another flute of champagne. She’s texting Tavros in another window, which is weird, but probably not as weird as John craning his neck to read messages over a teenage girl’s shoulder. The idea that Rose’s shitty daughter has more contact with his son than he does makes his eyes start to itch. He wanders out onto the ballroom balcony so that no one else has to see him cry for a second time tonight. It’s a balmy evening, and John can smell the oil burning at the forge across the harbor.</p>
    <p>There’s someone else occupying the balcony already, and it’s not one of the party guests. A shadow, standing with its back to the ocean, arms crossed, gaze fixed firmly on the ballroom windows. John takes a step closer and immediately recognizes Karkat’s nubby horns and distinctive shoulder-hunch. Of course.</p>
    <p>John snorts back his tears and jaunts forward with a jolly wave.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: hi, karkat!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Karkat blinks and looks up, startled out of his thoughts. He’s grown gaunt since John last saw him in real life. In his Alternian military fatigues, and his admittedly bitchin’ eyepatch, he looks almost imposing. Kind of dashing, actually. When he opens his mouth, however, he’s just the same old Karkat.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">John turns around so that he can rest his elbows on the bannister. The angle of the moon is cutting a sharp stroke of light over the water, like a blade descending from the night sky to shear the harbor in half. He takes a despondent sip of his champagne and sighs.</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: i dunno. it doesn’t seem responsible, really... to dedicate my life to something so important when i’m in a place where i can’t even find the energy to think that getting out of bed in the morning is “important.”</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: in fact, it seems like it would be a pretty fucking selfish thing to do.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: what if i get distracted because i’m sad?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: what if i fuck up by staring too tragically into the distance on an important mission, and i get killed in a stupid way?</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: JOHN, AREN’T YOU TECHNICALLY IMMORTAL *SPECIFICALLY* IN CASES OF “GETTING KILLED IN A STUPID WAY”?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: yeah. but you aren’t. and neither are most of your followers.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Karkat’s expression turns hard, regretful. It’s a frown made of granite, or some other manly kind of rock that chips easily when dropped. His one eye is glinting bright gold, reflecting the light from the party. He opens his mouth to say something, but is distracted by movement from inside the ballroom.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: OH SHIT. </p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: HERE COMES DAVE. I HAVE TO GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">He fumbles with something at his wrist, and out pops a grappling line. With unexpected smoothness, he hitches it over the edge of the balcony and leaps the railing in a single, elegant bound. John watches him rappel down the cliffside until he disappears beneath the precipice shadows. Wow. Karkat grew up to be kind of cool. Who would have guessed?</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: no john dont do it</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">John spins on his heel to see Dave in the doorway, holding a bottle of champagne. He looks smart in his three-piece tux, but he’s still sporting the same old Stiller shades, which always serve to remind John how hard it is to believe this guy’s almost forty. Jesus Christ, are they seriously almost forty? Yes, they’re technically immortal—that doesn’t mean the encroaching milestone isn’t making him feel dizzy nonetheless. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: huh? don’t do what?</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: haha dont literally commit suicide at my wedding dude lol</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: not to commit suicide at my fucking wedding is pretty obvious</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dave comes to join John at the bannister, gazing out over the water with a look at least as existential as John’s. John isn’t sure what to say about that, so he wiggles his empty glass, looking for another shot of sparkling social lubricant. Dave tops him off before taking a long swig off the bottle himself.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">John swallows a lump down his throat. Terezi’s picture is still in his wallet: faded, dog-eared, marred by ragged white lines down the center from being folded and unfolded so many times, deep enough to be called valleys at this point.</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: yo dude thanks for being my best man </p>

    <p class="no-indent">They toast, lip of the glass to rim of the bottle. The sound rings out above the noise of the party inside. It rises up above the ocean, to where the stars are turning and dawn is already breaking on some other part of the planet. That’s how the years pass. Faster and faster the longer it goes. For those living on this iteration of Earth C, like John and Dave, it appears to be an illusion of age, an old adage about perception changing the older you get. The days get shorter the more the regrets pile up.</p>
    <p>But that’s only part of it. Above this Earth, the dead cherub is still meditating, waiting for the day when she can have her own heroic apotheosis. Waiting for the day when she can confront the one she calls the Prince. And on this Earth, John is just waiting for the day that feeling finally stops. That feeling that he’s still waiting for something, and the even worse feeling that years ago, he missed his only chance to put an end to it. If you stand on a very high hill at dawn, you can watch your shadow move in an arc around you. </p>
    <p>Ten years to the day he last spoke with Terezi, John finally gets rid of her photograph. He stands at the top of a very high hill, rips it into six pieces and lets the wind carry it away. Whatever else happens now...  it doesn’t matter.</p></div>

    <p>John’s floating above the outskirts of the Human Capital, letting the breeze toss him to and fro. He’s hanging upside down in the air watching the first stage of the Troll Rebellion’s forward assault begin to establish their defensive position along the border. Despite the government’s paranoid crackdown on troll reproduction, they’ve ended up vastly outnumbered anyway thanks to the incalculable deluge of troll ghosts pouring down from the sky over the last decade. Someone with political opinions might think that this entire quagmire was one of the human government’s own making.</p>
    <p>John isn’t really on record as “having political opinions,” but he does think that the government approached this entire subject like it was trying to hold on to a water balloon by squeezing it too tight, and now it’s about to explode in their faces. He’s wondering if he should go see his son one last time before that happens. The battle is shaping up to be a pretty serious engagement. Both sides armed to the teeth, with all modern military technology at their disposal. Warships, laser guns, laser cannons, laser mines. Laser mines? Would those be mines that shot lasers, or lasers that tripped mines? John hasn’t been keeping up with the recent innovations in weaponry, although he has noted that the lock industry has finally started to take off. Dave said that this was all to be expected in a war economy. But John tuned out most of his analysis, which is what everyone does when Dave starts talking about the economy.</p>
    <p>A flash above the clouds catches John’s attention: another ghost, falling down from wherever it is they come from. John follows after the light with an exhausted sigh. The novelty of dead trolls falling from the sky has really worn off over the years. But he might as well go warn the new arrival that they’ve landed in the middle of an imminent warzone. He sets down at the edge of the crater and peers through the smoke. </p>
    <p>He recognizes the ghost immediately, because he sees a younger version of her almost every day.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">He hangs up on her and brings up his contacts so that he can text Jake and cancel all their televised fights for the foreseeable <em>forever</em>. He then blocks Jake’s number, because if it’s not worth explaining to Jane, it’s definitely not worth explaining to Jake. Then again, nothing is ever really worth explaining to Jake. Jake’s number is barely even worth storing in his phone, if Dirk is being perfectly honest. </p>
    <p>Through the workshop window, Dirk can see the sun touching the horizon. Ah, exquisite: he takes a moment to appreciate the sublime synthesis of the atmosphere and the existential crisis he is currently experiencing. The sun is setting both physically and metaphorically right now. <em>Not bad</em>, he thinks, then corrects himself, because while there is always time to delight in the volatility of causality, the whole situation is actually and for real <em>astonishingly</em> bad.</p></div>

    <p>The burden of the call he just received weighs so heavily upon him that it’s a struggle to propel himself each step forward. He wishes that someone else had gotten the news, but there’s nothing that can be done. He has to be there for his wife, even if he knows saying what he needs to say will be hard for both of them.</p>
    <p>The doors to the ship’s bridge slide open to permit him entry when he approaches. Jane is standing by the navigational stations, engaged in some sort of confabulation of doubtlessly critical importance with her eternal shadow, Gamzee Makara. Jake’s already miserable mood drops further at the sight of him—no matter how long this arrangement carries on, it never seems to get easier to stomach.</p>
    <p>Jane is dressed to the nines in her signature blazing-red power suit, her freshly polished designer pumps glinting in the varied lights of the Crockercorp ship command controls. The full entourage of the Crocker conglomerate is fast en route to a business conference that Jane insists is of the “utmost importance” to the impending negotiation of an array of paramilitary contracts with the government, and she would be the first to tell you that looking your best is one of the most critical parts of arbitration. </p>
    <p>She doesn’t immediately acknowledge Jake’s presence when he approaches. He has to conspicuously clear his throat before Jane turns her attention away from Gamzee, and even then she only dignifies Jake’s appearance with a fleeting glance. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Do you need something?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Well... i have some terrible news i’m afraid. </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: What is it, Jake? I’m rather occupied at the moment. </p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Im awfully sorry to bother you but its very important dear.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Is something the matter with Tavros? </p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: No... eh heh you might want to come with me to our quarters for this one.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: ...As I said, I’m a bit busy right now.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: W-well I just thought. Maybe its best if you s-sit down for this one. My dear. </p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: My delectable honey bunches of oats.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: The jolly ole capn of my crunch.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: M-m-my lovely wife whom i love so much.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jane’s face twists in annoyance. She is quite a bit shorter than Jake now, but the way she looks down on him makes her seem like she towers ten feet above him.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: My <em>goodness</em>, Jake! What do you want? Can’t you see I’m right in the middle of something?! Just spit it out already!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">The whole bridge goes quiet at Jane’s outburst. Everyone has stopped in the midst of their tasks to stare nervously at the altercation. The only other sound that penetrates the silence is Gamzee noisily slurping on the rubber nipple of his baby bottle. </p>
    <p>Jake swallows like he’s in a cartoon. It’s a big, loud gulp. A sound that instantly rachets up Jane’s annoyance—like most of Jake’s actions seem to, these days. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: I... </p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Well you see...  </p>

    <p class="jake">JAKE: I just got news that your father has passed jane. Im so sorry.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">At first the words don’t quite register. Jane expected this, like all interactions with Jake, to be a meaningless waste of her time. Initially she gives a dismissive nod, like she’s taking in some trivial piece of information. And then the weight of the statement strikes her, sending a jolt of shock through her chest.</p>
    <p>It passes quickly, though. She’d almost forgotten.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: An unfortunate incident, but it’s no matter.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: I’ll simply revive him, and then make sure he’s assigned a security detail.</p>

    <p class="jake">JAKE: I...</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Im afraid that wont be possible honey.</p>

    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: What?</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: What... what happened?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: It... word from the secret service is that it was one of karkats assassins.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: The target was the human president.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: He uhhh. Your father that is... </p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: He jumped in the way and took the shot.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: The president is safe.</p>

    <p class="jane">JANE: Did Karkat’s rebels abduct him?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Er... no.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: The shot he took was from the barrel of a rocket launcher.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Im afraid the assault blew him straight to bits. Theres hardly anything left...</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: W... what...</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Luckily the president was barely harmed as your old man took the full brunt.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: As far as i know the only harm to him was having his full lustrous mustache burned clean off his face.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Its... its a friggin tragedy... :’(</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: (Sniffle.)</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake’s gaze falls to the floor. Jane’s hand clutches at the front of her suit in an unsteady fist.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: P... please tell me you’re joking.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Jake, tell me this is just a prank.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Im... im afraid not jane.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Im so sorry.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jane whips around, tears in her eyes. The whole bridge is holding its breath. She feels every eye on her then, the pressure to hold it together. She can’t show weakness now. She’s come so far. </p>
    <p>Jane sniffles and swipes at her eyes with the back of her hand. She won’t cry. But she can be angry instead.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: UGH!</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: That... that fool!!</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: I can’t believe that he would do this!</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: How could he do this to me!?!</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Janey...</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: The human president could be anyone! </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: My dad can’t be anyone but him!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake isn’t sure this is the right or smart thing to do, but he chances it: he steps forward to place a comforting hand on Jane’s shoulder. When she doesn’t immediately tear herself away, he tentatively—and slowly, like he’s approaching a wounded animal—pulls her into a hug.</p>
    <p>Jane is too dazed to protest. She limply stares past Jake, eyes unfocused.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: I don’t... no... </p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Shhhh. Shhhh. Everythings going to be ok.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: God. I can’t believe he... </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Oh, but of course I can.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: He’s always been...  </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Always been so infuriatingly good.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: God, how stupid.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: This is so stupid. I’m so stupid. How could I put him in such a dangerous position?</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Chief of staff?! Anyone could have done that job! Why did I tell him to... my own father... I—</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Shhh. Janey. You did nothing wrong.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Nothing wrong at all.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: You never have.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Gamzee turns to the bridge crew and gestures magnificently with his arms. Rivulets of milk are running down his chin.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="gamzee">GAMZEE: hOnK iF yOu LoVe ThIs BiG tItTy BiZzNaTcH!</p>
    <p class="gamzee">GAMZEE: WhOoP wHoOp!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">A petrified pall falls across the bridge as the crew tries to figure out whether they’re supposed to take this seriously or not. The comms officer shares a look with the engineer. The conning officer looks like she’s about to shit her pants. And then they turn to the most pitiable stooge of them all for answers.</p>
    <p>Jake’s eyebrows shoot up to his hairline and he nods urgently over Jane’s shoulder to indicate that, yes, they should definitely do it. At once, the bridge crew gives a unanimous honk.</p>
    <p>Jane sniffs and pulls away out of Jake’s embrace. She turns back to the bridge and takes a forward step, stumbling slightly in her heels. But she catches her balance, fixes her posture, and slips back on a stony mask. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: All right.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Jake! Get the president on the phone.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: It’s clear to me now that it’s past time for the military to strike, and I’ll be giving that man a real piece of my mind until an appropriate counterattack is in motion.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Obviously, the government’s attempts to be gracious with the troll ilk have been naive and foolish.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: These rats cannot be negotiated with. They cannot be swayed by reason or appeals to peace and civility.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: The only thing that they want—the only thing that they have ever wanted since the ungodly inception of their disgusting, verminous species—is bloodshed.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: And if that is what they truly desire... </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Well, far be it from us to deny them.</p>

    <p class="jane">JANE: EVERY LAST FUCKING ONE OF THEM!</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: I HAVE HAD ENOUGH! THIS IS THE END OF THE LINE!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jane is blazing with fury. She marches to the center of the bridge.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: ALL OF YOU, RETURN TO YOUR STATIONS! WE ARE CHANGING COURSE!</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: WE WILL BE GOING DIRECTLY TO MEET WITH THE PRESIDENT, AND I WILL NOT REST UNTIL HE GIVES THE COMMAND TO CRUSH THIS FUCKING REBELLION AND DESTROY ANY CHANCE THAT THEY MIGHT EVER RESIST AGAIN!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">The bridge crew doesn’t even think to defy Jane’s orders. They return to their stations, dutiful. The navigator adjusts the ship’s destination coordinates, and the comms officer opens a line with the government’s seat of command. Only one man in the room is brave enough to take a stand.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">And then Gamzee seals his fate. He reaches out with his finger and boops Jane right on her little nose. Honk!</p>
    <p>Jake audibly gasps at the sight—but Jane does not have any sort of violent outburst of anger. Instead, she goes completely, icily silent.</p>
    <p>Gamzee smiles vacantly down at Jane, unaware of his misstep. When Jane next speaks, it is in a controlled, steady voice.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="no-indent">The security personnel aboard the bridge do not hesitate to follow the command. They descend on Gamzee in a swarm, grabbing him by his arms. The baby bottle tumbles out of his grasp, busting open when it falls. The remaining milk spills out, pooling in the recessed lighting of the floor.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Jane turns, and waves the security away. The uniformed men drag Gamzee from the bridge. The sound of honks reverberate hauntingly through the halls as the wretched jester is removed from his seat of power at last.</p>
    <p>In spite of everything, Jake can’t help but be relieved.</p>
    <p>With Gamzee finally disposed of, Jane is invigorated with the strength of her own conviction. She spins on her heel and confidently strides to the captain’s chair. She engages her interface, sits down, and assumes her seat of command.</p>
    <p>The time for mercy is long past. Karkat Vantas must die.</p></div>

    <p class="john">JOHN: ok, sure.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: so about fifteen years ago, jane started spreading all this xenophobic propaganda about trolls.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: and eventually she and her corporation became so entrenched in financial dealings with basically every societal institution with power on earth c that she became this unstoppable lobbying monolith that can more or less tell the government what to do.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: so now she may as well be writing all of these xenophobic policies into law directly.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: oh, jane’s a huge xenophobe, by the way?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i probably should have started out with that fact.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): John, this story fucking sucks.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: oh, and then karkat had this really catastrophic breakup with jade and dave, so he ran off to spearhead a troll rebellion against the xenophobic government. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: to be honest, the rebellion was pretty lame in the beginning, but then, um... meenah? </p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): Meenah?!</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: yeah! meenah. she fell out of the sky, like you just did, and helped him actually get good at revolutionary stuff.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: so now both sides are all maxed out with space ships and weapons and stuff, and are on the brink of war.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): Holy shit. That’s even dumber than Rose and Kanaya naming their shitty kid after me.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: oh man, their kid IS shitty. you have NO idea.</p>

    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): HOW?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i was supposed to go fight lord english, but i didn’t. so now we’ve gone beyond, like, the event horizon of canon.</p>

The bulk of Karkat and Meenah’s fleet has just arrived. Their ships are less sleek and imposing than Jane’s, most of them having been scavenged, patchworked, and jury-rigged. But they’re numerous enough to blot out the sun when they coast overhead. </p>

Gamzee’s hair is caked with dirt, his makeup is smudged, and he’s sucking on his milk bottle in the style of some smooth hombre in a spaghetti western mouthing a cigar. He tugs the rubber nipple out of his mouth with a pop. The chalky, viscous milk forms a goatee of spittle on his chin.</p>

Slowly, she stalks towards him, her feet pressing so heavily in the soft earth she might as well weigh a thousand pounds.

His posture is so contemptibly flaccid, it’s as if he’s literally wilting. Her gaze travels to where his weird, long fingers are wrapped around the curve of her shoulder. His hand is sticky for some reason. She notices a few strands of her black hair clinging to whatever heinous substance is coating his hand. It’s an image so viscerally objectionable to her that she nearly vomits. After all she’s been through today, this... THIS is the last goddamned straw. Her eyes fill with fury, with indignation, with vivid, radiating malevolence, and then it finally happens. </p>

    <p class="no-indent">Gamzee tries to get his bearings, but (Vriska)’s spinning back in the other direction with a Discus Back Elbow. Her elbow connects with his cheekbone hard enough that it shatters. A sharp tooth goes flying out of his puckered lips so fast that John has to take flight to avoid it. (Vriska) takes a crow’s hop back, grounding herself to swing a lead-legged kick right into his chin. Gamzee goes flying into a nearby tree. The first branch splinters under the impact of his spine. He gets clotheslined backward by the second one, spins around it and face-plants on a hard root under the tree.</p>
    <p>John winces, but not sympathetically. The impact was just that rough. That HAD to crack a rib or two.</p>
    <p>(Vriska) stalks over to Gamzee and triumphantly lifts him off the ground, high above her head, only to drop him and slam her knee into his face again. His lip splits, staining her jeans bright purple. He’s rolling from side to side on the ground, groaning as blood bubbles up from his mouth. It sounds like he’s drowning. (Vriska) drags him to his feet again, her hands fisted in his shirt. With an impressive maneuver, hard for the eye to follow unless you’re a trained wrestler, she adroitly twists a hand in his hair and Reverse Hangmans him against the tree branch. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="gamzee">GAMZEE: HONK!!!!</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): WHY WON’T YOU JUST</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She slams his throat against the branch again and again. Each time he lets out a sound like a damaged squeeze toy, his bloated, slimy tongue unspooling like a frog’s as all the air is crushed out of his esophagus. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): D8EEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Shouting like a berserker, (Vriska) perpetrates a textbook Groinal Clawhold around Gamzee’s codpiece and rips it right the fuck off. He yowls as if he had actual testicles to be mauled, and for all anyone knows, maybe he really does. He paws the air desperately and fecklessly after his treasured purple dick-sock, but (Vriska) tosses it over her shoulder and shoves him into the mud with her heel. She grabs Gamzee by the hood, pulls him up, and then grinds the top of her shoe along the ridge of his broken nose, rubbing her laces into his eyes.</p>
    <p>Ah yes, John pauses his wince to admire, the good old Bootlace Eyerake. Jake loved that one back in the day, even though he had much more practice with the receiving end of it.</p>
    <p>Gamzee grabs (Vriska)’s foot by the bridge. Instead of yanking her off-balance, he opens his huge, bloody maw of a mouth and... runs his tongue along the rubber bottom of her shoe? (Vriska) freezes. She watches him lap the mud—and his own blood—out from between the grooves of the sole. His lips drag lewdly over the ridge of her footwear and begin sucking at where her big toe would be, if it were not safely ensconced in several layers of rubber and canvas. He draws back, a string of glutinous, tinted saliva connecting the shoe to his lip, and catches (Vriska)’s eyes with his own half-lidded gaze. His face is bruised, bloody, swollen. His makeup is a nightmarish disaster. But the expression he’s giving her is unmistakable. It’s not fear, not rage, not even pain. It’s...  </p>
    <p>Lust. </p>
    <p>(Vriska) goes perfectly still, absolutely paralyzed by the sudden recognition. For several seconds, she doesn’t dare move a muscle.</p>
    <p>And then, quite suddenly, (Vriska) reaches a plateau of rage so intense, so pure, that she isn’t even seeing straight anymore. She howls like a storm cresting over the ocean, drowning out the sound of the human government’s tanks firing their first volley over the battlefield. She lunges at Gamzee’s catastrophic face lips-first, and practically dives into his mouth, ramming her tongue into his lewd, gaping maw like she’s questing for prizes at a carnival. They roll over each other, groping, tearing, tongue-lashing, and vanish into the underbrush. </p>
    <p>Gamzee’s unwashed stench is so bad, the motion of him being knocked into the dirt wafts it in John’s direction. The stink hits him like an olfactory haymaker, and he does a full 180 to dry heave into the impact crater. </p>
    <p>Mercifully, John’s attention is caught by someone calling his name from above. He has never felt so grateful for an excuse to look away from anything in his life.</p>

John tries to smile at her, but all he can muster is a weird, queasy expression. Rose looks glad to see him anyway. She drops to the ground when the modest cruiser comes in for a landing, followed out, regrettably, by her daughter, Vriska.</p>
    <p>Shit. John flies up to greet them, more quickly than he would ordinarily in a situation where he wasn’t trying to divert his friend’s and her teenage daughter’s attentions away from a couple making out in a bush. He dips forward like he’s going in to hug Vriska (to her apparent surprise, due to his historical complete lack of desire for any physical contact to be made between them), but instead uses his momentum to spin her all the way around so that her back is facing the cursed shrubbery in the distance.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Whoa! Hey, Old Man.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: hey vriska, hey rose. nice to see you both! </p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">John and Rose appear equally surprised themselves when Vriska hauls him in to seal the deal with a crushing hug of her own.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: haha. geez! hi vriska!</p>
    <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Hi John!</p>

    <p class="rose">ROSE: O... kay? If that’s what you want.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: oh yeah, it’s the thing i want most. the view on the other side of this ship is just... AMAZING. trust me.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Rose cocks an eyebrow at him. Behind her, the bush releases a strangled, lusty honk. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Was that...</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Nevermind. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Vriska, why don’t you go and help your mother with the deployments?</p>
    <p class="vriska">VRISKA: UGH. I can’t 8elieve I have to Actually Listen to you now that we’re At War.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Run along now, dear.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Thankfully, Vriska heeds her mother’s command and heads back to the cruiser. Rose tries to glance back toward the source of the suspicious honk, but John pulls her behind the ship, beyond audible range of the activity taking place in the offensive bush. </p>
    <p>On this side of the cruiser, troops are departing the hold in single-file efficiency. They’re all decked out in full Alternian military garb. It’s the cool, Tron-looking stuff with the luminescent cording that matches their blood colors. Rose is wearing it too, John notices, in black and lavender. He gives her a concerned look up and down, then holds out his hands, palms up.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: so... i guess this war is really happening?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I understand that you don’t want to be involved, and I respect your decision. However, I wanted to speak with you before we left.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: oh, thanks. i actually appreciate that a lot.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i think i would have been pretty bummed if you went off to your potential doom without saying goodbye.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: now that i think about it, that’s how this all started, isn’t it?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: you were so sick that it looked like you were dying, and i was about to leave on a perilous mission. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: but now, here we are.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: it’s almost like...  </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: the circle of stupidity is complete?</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Rose laughs. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Don’t be ridiculous John. Nothing is complete.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: There is no true ending or beginning in this scenario.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: ha ha. yeah, right. because this is real life, right?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i guess reading narrative relevance into a bunch of dumb and totally random events is kind of lame and childish. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: No, that isn’t what I meant at all.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: By all means, apply a narrative to our lives. Up until a certain point, it would have been perfectly accurate to do so.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But not anymore.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: because... it’s not canon, right?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Do you remember what I told you years ago? About the three pillars of canon?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: um. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">John strokes his chin and thinks very hard on this. Maybe too long, because Rose sighs and taps the bridge of his spectacles.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: “No” is a perfectly valid answer to that question, John. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i just didn’t want to make it look like i don’t pay attention to your wordy philosophical babble!</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I philosophically babble rather a lot, or at least I used to. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It would be unfair of me to expect you to retain nearly three decades of oblique technical jargon regarding the metaphysics of the reality in which we inhabit.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: wow, we’ve known each other a long time.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes, we have.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Well.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It would be more accurate to say that we both have and haven’t known each other a long time.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: As I explained to you on that morning sixteen years ago, there are three critical features of canon: essentiality, relevance, and truth.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: yeah.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: We have been untethered from the mooring of “truth” for some time now.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: So while we, in our subjective experiences of conscious perception, feel in this moment that we have known each other for a very long time, technically it’s not true at all.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Contemplating the vastness of that statement makes John feel suddenly very small and sad. He shuts his eyes and runs a hand through his hair.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: oh my god, rose. it’s too early in the day for this.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I agree.</p>

    <p class="rose">ROSE: John.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Look at me.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Rose wraps her narrow hands around John’s arms and pulls him gently toward her. He cracks his eyes open to see her face glimmering in the late morning sun. Her eyes are glossy and bright in the gleaming light.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I want to thank you.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: for... for what?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: didn’t i fuck everything up by not going to fight lord english?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: it’s my fault we’re all living in this meaningless hell world where everyone’s vaguely out of their minds, and we’re all about to go to war over... freeing prisoners from the whipping cream camps!</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Oh, whatever.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: The war is just as irrelevant as everything else that’s happened here in the last decade and a half.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: At least with a conflict, we have something to DO.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Something to strive for and against. Something to believe in.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I’m thankful for that. But more than anything, John, I’m thankful that I got a chance to be happy.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I never... </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Rose pauses meaningfully, as if the realization is falling into place as she says it.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I never thought I would actually get to be happy.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: rose... you weren’t happy before?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: when you married kanaya? before you got sick? when we were all together?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Rose shakes her head. She brushes past John, out toward the open field, away from the brewing battle. The land is so flat that it rushes out to meet the horizon uninterrupted for miles and miles. Rose is a pale flame against the brilliant haze of a perfect Earth C morning. </p>
    <p>John doesn’t follow after her. He lets her compose herself privately with her back to him. She clasps her hands in front of her and raises her head to look at the perfectly blue sky with its perfect sun and its perfect clouds, unmarred by the dark storm brewing on the planet below.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: In Complacency of th—</p>

    <p class="no-indent">She corrects herself.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: In the silly wizard story I wrote when I was a child,</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: The realm most comparable to heaven existed in a state of subliminal conditionality, dependent on the inscience of the individual experiencing it.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Which is to say that it would cease to exist the moment you realized what it was.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: And so, those with knowledge could never truly be happy.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">John looks at his hands. The same hands that held Harry Anderson when he was a baby. The same hands that tore up Terezi’s photograph just a few hours ago. The same hands that remember steadying Rose on her sickbed sixteen years ago, and the shaking feeling they’d awoken with that morning: a subharmonic symphony that can only be heard in the bones. All things that remain “true” to him. Knowledge of what came before his choice, and then after. There are things that he can’t forget. That he won’t forget. Is this the reason he’s felt like this for so many years?</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But that isn’t me anymore.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I am blind against the veil of this world.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s all ambrosia to me.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I don’t care if it’s not true. I care even less if it’s not canon.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I have a beautiful wife who I love more than I thought possible, and a daughter who I am immeasurably proud of. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It can all be senseless, ephemeral noise that dissolves in the void. A whisper swept up by the wind before it’s uttered.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I’m still grateful to have felt this way.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: So, John...</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Rose turns around, smiling. The smile is calm and honest. Her eyes are perfectly clear. There is no other word that could possibly do justice to her expression. She looks happy.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Thank you.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She comes forward to give him a kiss on the cheek. John wraps his arms around her shoulders, pulls her into a tight hug, and breathes in the scent of her hair. Whatever the truth of the matter is, she still feels tangible and real to him. What does it mean to be real, anyway?</p>
    <p>Around them, the first wave of bombs start to go off. Bright pinpricks of light and dark that flash and flame out, leaving a nanosecond of absolute, dead silence in their wake.</p>
    <p>John’s laughing when they part. They’re enveloped in a cloud of smoke and dirt so thick that they can barely see each other. Despite what Rose said about there being no ends or beginnings for them anymore, it feels very final. And in that moment, he thinks he understands. Finality was always up to him. </p>
    <p>He finally decides to allow it.</p></div>

    <p class="no-indent">Vriska stops trying to eavesdrop on John’s blubbering for a moment. She’s distracted by another noise. She whips her head around to detect an all-too-familiar sound echoing above the post-bombing silence. It’s a sound that she knows from hard-won experience can mean only one thing.</p>
    <p>There’s a clown nearby.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">The dust is beginning to settle around Vriska’s ankles. She scans the tree line and brings all her attention to bear on this curious rhythm of noises coming from nearby, beckoning from the underbrush. She pushes toward it through the thorny shrubbery.</p>

    <p>Vriska’s huge, mischievous smile freezes on her face. When her eyes pass the image to her brain, and it finally makes sense of this incomprehensible jumble of gray limbs, blue and purple slop, tangled black hair, and stunned faces, her expression begins to slowly melt. It then drifts quickly, from phase to phase, to one of wonder, then anguish, and finally, abject horror.</p>

She’s resolved to do everything in her power to prevent herself from thinking about the situation directly behind her. It is a situation which, if she could bear to look at it, would strike her as the precise intersection between the most humiliating moment of her existence, an unprecedented circus mishap, and a gruesome crime scene. Her attempt to ignore the unspeakable catastrophe behind her may nearly have worked, if not for the reminder provided by the many fresh bloodstains on her shirt. Not only stains of her own familiar cerulean hue, but others of a most unwelcome color mingling with them. A color she never imagined she’d see contaminating her cool and casual ensemble, and certainly not in a context like this. </p>
    <p>Her attempt to distract herself, to delay the inevitable engagement with her poor judgment, would not fly for much longer. Sooner or later, she would have to turn around and confront the fact that she just kissed a very smelly clown, head-on. </p>
    <p>No. She doesn’t want to. She WON’T.</p>
    <p>There’s a rustling in the grass behind her, as Gamzee shifts his grotesque, supine length. Nope. She covers her ears. She remembers the shame and excoriation of her childhood—the fear, the pressure, being coerced to do awful things to undeserving kids. All that embarrassing effort she spent trying to emulate her ancestor. She threw every bit of herself into the role, but in recent years reflecting on the charade has only made her cringe. And in what couldn’t have been more than an hour ago, she was on the precipice of watching the glorious defeat of Lord English after unleashing a secret weapon that she went to the bother of retrieving and wielding against him. And then… </p>
    <p>No, she doesn’t want to dwell on that moment. It was almost as bad as kissing a juggalo. Almost. But nothing can compete with this. Nothing could even come close. Yet as she stands there, feeling soiled and ashamed, there’s no denying it. The moment she stuck her tongue in the heinous mouth of that frisky, unwashed jester, she began jackhammering through the stubborn concrete of rock bottom like she was digging up the corpse of a mob snitch. </p>

    <p class="no-indent">She shudders. Somehow during her self-incriminating reverie, she’d managed to forget that she’s not even Vriska anymore. She’s now (Vriska). She scans the bushes and spots her. The sixteen-year-old girl who’d somehow earned the right to call herself Vriska. The adopted teen daughter of Rose and Kanaya Maryam-Lalonde. The person who, for all anyone knew, might be an exact genetic double of (Vriska) herself. </p>
    <p>Not that she had any grounds to object. She missed her shot. Snatched shame from the jaws of glory and washed up on the shores of this candy-coated shithole of an approximation of what a paradise planet might look like to certain individuals. The small sob she’s been stifling finally comes out. Tears cut through the oily, shining mask of blue, purple, and mud on her face. </p>

    <p class="no-indent">Her final sniffle is a snort of anger. If nothing else, she’s learning something about herself today. Nothing sobers her up emotionally quite like the post-amorous insubordination of a raunchy clown. It’s almost like a smelling salt. She sneers, revealing a fang, and spins on her heel to face him.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">If his infuriating exclamation was just a whiff of the smelling salt, actually looking directly at him again is like upending the whole barrel and pouring it all over her face. She recoils involuntarily, but regroups. Her gaze sweeps across his entire ungainly form from head to foot. He’s got his head propped up with one arm, elbow in the grass. His legs are crossed. His face is a disaster. One eye swollen shut, nose broken, widely-smiling mouth split vertically down the lips. And hanging from his mouth is...</p>
    <p>Is that a baby bottle?</p>
    <p>She doesn’t even want to think about where he might have been concealing it all this time. What sort of milk was that? It’s another question she immediately wishes she hadn’t just asked herself. She curls the other side of her lip to reveal both fangs now. She stomps forward, plants her left foot in the ground, and uses her right to punt the baby bottle clean out of his mouth, sending it flying several hundred yards to land just beyond a distant row of trees. The rubber nipple remains stuck in his clenched teeth, his face now coated with a good portion of the punted bottle’s milk. </p>

    <p class="no-indent">She glares down at him with an intensity that would cause any other man to wither, were he not a reeking pile of circus manure. Gamzee’s expression however remains steadfast in its vaguely lewd sense of serenity. He simply gazes back at her, his smile slowly broadening. The milk seems to be mixing with the blood on his face, slightly lightening the tint of the purple.</p>
    <p>She hears a faint digital clicking somewhere. What is that? It seems to be coming from just behind her. She turns around.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">At the end of his long, outstretched arm, his hand is working a smartphone. He’s smearing blood on the screen as he’s typing a text to someone. Even at a casual glance, (Vriska) can tell he’s going to the bother of alternating capital and lowercase letters in the text, making it take more than twice as long. Somehow this makes her even more pissed off about it than if he were just broadcasting their snogging fiasco without the use of a typing quirk.</p>

    <p>She drops down and straddles him in a way that is unmistakably non-amorous, even to an extraordinarily obtuse, randy juggalo. She puts her shaking hands around his neck and grips tight. She positions her face inches from his, hissing hot breath through her clenched teeth.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">(Vriska) is so furious, she has no way of pinpointing the exact moment her intent stopped being intimidating him into silence and started being guaranteeing his silence, forever. She knows this impostor was never a real god tier. She’s always known, just like everyone else. Once he’s gone, he’ll be gone for good. She just needs another minute. Her grip grows tighter, and she feels the throbbing pulse beneath her hands gradually subside. His arms flail, grab at hers, clutch at her wrists. He’s alarmingly strong. But at this particular moment, not as strong as her.</p>
    <p>And then, she lets go. His face is frozen in a repellent mask exhibiting the perfectly undetectable difference between terror and ecstasy. He’s dead.</p>
    <p>(Vriska) exhales forcefully, staggers to her feet, shaking. She backs up a few steps, studying the corpse. If her body language signals any remorse or sadness, the witness in the bushes certainly can’t tell.</p>

He simply had no further capacity to deal with any of it. He just fucked off. </p>
    <p>A few hours of aimless wandering through the sky brought him back here, to his old house. He hasn’t lived here in years, but it feels exactly as it had when he last left it. It’s like no time has passed at all. John leans back in his dad’s desk chair, stares at the ceiling and listens to the war. </p>
    <p>The steady drone of weaponized airships up above has become so commonplace in everyday life that he barely even notices it anymore. But now he focuses, trying to pick out the individual sounds. No matter how hard he tries, he can’t tell which ship belongs to which side, or how many there are. He doesn’t know whether they’re coming or going. Rose, Kanaya, and their daughter are probably up there somewhere by now.</p>
    <p>The washing machine chugs along in the next room. In John’s experience, troll blood is incredibly difficult to wash out of clothes. His t-shirt is probably going to be Vriska-colored for the rest of its life. </p>
    <p>Somehow, no matter what, he always seems to end up back in this house. It’s been through the Medium and two different universes, and come out of it with only a slight warping to the foundations. Everything is coated in dust. He hasn’t bothered to turn any lights on, or change any of the bulbs that have burned out over the past few years. He thought he heard someone moving around upstairs a while ago, but he didn’t get up to check. He hasn’t gotten up for... how long has passed? He has no idea. </p>
    <p><em>Creak. Creaaaak.</em> God, this house is rattly. It could be a wild animal up there. It could be a thief. John doesn’t think he has anything he’d regret losing. At least not anything that he hasn’t already lost. </p>
    <p>His dad’s study looks the same as it had the day he moved out. Figurines, jauntily-hung photographs of famous funnymen, even the dent in the floor from the time Rose dropped a safe on a bunch of troublesome imps. He’d always meant to hire someone to fix it, he just... never got around to it. It’s the perfect room for a slow-motion existential crisis. </p>
    <p>If that’s what you can even call whatever it is he’s going through. Maybe it’s not so much of a crisis as a critical cessation of his ability to give a shit.</p>
    <p>Where an hour ago he’d been feeling blissfully unburdened by his solipsistic revelation, now the significance of everything’s insignificance overwhelms him. He wishes he could find comfort in the frivolity like Rose has, but it’s impossible for him to delude himself. If nothing matters, what is the point of doing anything? Where is he supposed to go from here? How do you figure out how to fill your time when you have all of a meaningless eternity ahead of you?</p>
    <p>He’s not sure why his brain thought he’d find an answer in this place. He swivels back and forth in his father’s dusty desk chair, staring listlessly up at the featureless white expanse of the ceiling of the study. His mind runs in exhausting circles until he dozes off to a lullaby of distant sonic booms.</p>
    <p>When next he’s jostled awake, it’s by a figure that looks uncomfortably like—</p>

    <p class="no-indent">As John blinks away the sleep from his eyes, the man looming over him comes into focus. It’s not his dad—it’s Jake Crocker. Who actually is his dad, but in a far more esoterically bullshit way than the man who used to fill this study with pipes and black licorice. John sits up straight in the chair and rubs at his eyes. </p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake scrunches up his face in the same way Harry Anderson does when he’s lying. Across the room, Tavros Crocker fumbles his grasp on a particularly hideous fanciful harlequin. One of its pointy shoes snaps off. </p>

    <p class="jake">JAKE: What i did that is. Thats the thing thats looking like that. Hoo... </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake is one whole wince now, and John knows he should invite him to sit down and maybe offer  him something to drink. Or at least a pair of pants. But all this is is another reminder of how inescapably preposterous every aspect of this reality has become. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: so i guess this is the thing that’s currently happening now. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: what exactly do you want me to do?</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: help you out?</p>

    <p class="no-indent">John produces a dry laugh.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: that’s pretty funny.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i remember trying to help you for years, and you never seemed that interested back then. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake was apparently not expecting John’s sharp tone. He flinches back like a kicked dog. Or a dog who has been kicked so many times he assumes any helping hand is a slap.</p>
    <p>All the same, John finds it hard to feel much sympathy. Who <em>is </em>Jake? The one standing in front of him now, anyway. Has he always been this contemptibly pathetic, or is this too a function of the absurdity of this contorted reality? It’s hard to be sure. Are Jake’s “struggles” worth any more of John’s guilt and emotional energy than a Sim stuck in a pool without a ladder?</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Look here chap sometimes not everything is so simple!</p>

    <p class="jake">JAKE: None of this happened overnight john!</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Its just like you go to take a dip in the water and everything starts out cool and fine...</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: But then it just keeps getting hotter and hotter. Gradually. Degree by degree.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: So slowly that by the time the waters boiling you dont even realize youre being scalded alive!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">John isn’t listening to Jake anymore. He’s looking at Jake’s son, who has returned to going methodically through the stuff on the desk, moving objects around, looking like he wants to shrink down into nothing. Tavros, who looks more like him than even Harry Anderson does. </p>
    <p>Something in John’s stomach churns. The ridiculous fate of this facsimile of his friend is one thing, but Tavros...</p>
    <p>If things really are the way they seem, isn’t <em>he</em> John’s fault, too? Did his reckless decision really author a <em>child</em>, just for it to suffer?</p>
    <p>John finds himself feeling a little sick.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: are you guys... i don’t know, hungry, or whatever? </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i think i have a frozen pizza. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">He brings them into the kitchen, which still has all of the old appliances from decades ago—the stand mixer, the automatic can opener, the milkshake frother. He never uses any of this junk; it clutters the place up and he should have cleaned it all out years ago. He just kept coming up with excuses for why he had to leave it as it was.</p>
    <p>John has never been much of a drinker, but fortunately Jake English is never found without a bottle these days. He’s got a forty-year-old whiskey that he “grabbed on his way out.” Apparently his unwillingness to steal from Jane did not extend to her liquor cabinet. Tavros takes one look at the bottle in his father’s hand and heads upstairs. Maybe that’s for the best—it’s getting hard for John to look straight at him.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: i’m sorry for being... i don’t know. a bitch.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: it’s just been kind of a rough forever.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: No offense taken chap! Whisky?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: As you may know im not in truth the biggest fan of the stuff but it gets the job done right quick eh.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">John accepts the offered glass and takes a sip. Regardless of the existential status of this reality, the alcohol tastes just as harsh and bitter as he remembers it. Jake swirls the rocks in his glass, looking queasy despite his proclamation of tolerance.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: John.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Do you think im a bad person?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">That’s certainly not a question John ever expected to hear come out of Jake’s mouth. He hadn’t thought him capable of that degree of introspection. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: wait. what?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Do you think ive ruined my whole entire life and all of my relationships and especially the most important relationship in ones life, the divine and unbreakable bond between a man and his son?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: haha.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: um.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: not sure if i’m the best person to talk to about this, considering i kind of did the same thing?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: but, no. i don’t really think that.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: it’s not as if anything that’s happened to you is your fault, like, existentially.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: or like, even non-existentially. i guess even in straightforward non-metatextual-jerkoff terms it’s also not your fault your wife was treating you like shit?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: it may be all my fault in both an existential and non-existential capacity, so i wouldn’t sweat it too much either way.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Eh? What do you mean?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i don’t think you’d really understand.</p>

    <p class="jake">JAKE: Except i would have been drinking flat cherry coke back then probably. Gran left an astounding amount of cherry coke behind when she died and it took forever to get through it all.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">John wonders if everything being out of his control would make him feel better. Even if he weren’t presently stuck sucking on this bitter cosmic red pill, he can’t imagine being particularly happy with this worldstate. Maybe it just would’ve made it all the more soul-crushing.</p>
    <p>Or maybe he is doing exactly what Jake has always done. In a certain light, isn’t ascribing all this mess to some unconscious influence he might have had over the metaphysical shape of reality just a way to brush off his simpler failures as a man and a father? </p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: jake, i guess i actually don’t know you that well, but i think there’s a difference between making excuses and just giving reasons.</p>

A faint but steady glow pulses from Jake’s body, radiating like heat from a fire. John can’t help but recoil a little, like a vampire in the sunlight.</p>
    <p>He wishes bitterly that it could be so easy for <em>him</em>. To just forget all his fears and regrets, and forge forward with the honest, dumb conviction that if he just <em>tries hard enough</em> all his problems can be chased away.</p>

Jake leads relentlessly, but it’s the glow of his ridiculous god tier magic that brings John down enough for his feet to touch the ground. Whether John wants it or not, there’s something inescapably infectious about Jake’s senselessly optimistic energy.

    <p class="no-indent">Hearing the name is like a blow to the chest. Little Harry Anderson. His son, who he held and fed and taught and raised into a young man. Despite it all, he’s always been so unbelievably proud of that boy. </p>
    <p>If Roxy isn’t real, then his son must be even faker. </p>
    <p>Something about the thought makes John feel more rotten than anything else. Maybe it’s some aspect of his basic biology, buried down at the core of his lizard brain, that makes him want to reject what he knows is true. The allure of the denial—of the anaesthetic hope radiating from Jake’s epically sculpted body—is difficult to turn away from. </p>

Which by all accounts involved a lot of leisure time—floating around, lounging about on golden crenellations, and looking at pretty much the only thing there was to look at on Prospit: the big blue sphere full of prescient clouds known as Skaia. She’s certain Terezi must have spent more than her share of time ogling the fluffy nimbus forms, or sniffing in their direction at least. </p>
    <p>This must have been what life on Prospit felt like, (Vriska) thinks, as she adjusts her head to a slightly more comfortable position on the fresh clown carcass she’s now using as a pillow. She lets out a long exhale, feeling more relaxed than she’s felt in a long time. The clouds aren’t showing her any visions, but that’s okay. She realizes you can see whatever you want to see in a cloud, if you spend a long enough time looking at its shape. All that’s really required is a willingness to let yourself waste the time. A willingness she only just discovered minutes ago, since wringing the life from a libidinous harlequin.  </p>

    <p class="vriska">VRISKA: It’s a Thing you Smoke with.</p>

Her parents have told her many tales of Alternia, and her curiosity about the subject was satiated some time before she entered high school. She shrugs and turns her attention back to the sky. Another nimbus cloud wanders lazily into view, and catches (Vriska)’s eye due to its peculiar shape.</p>

    <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Oh yeah, it totally is.</p>
    <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Just a fuckin’ Sky Hat. Right there.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">(Vriska) scans the sky. She notices a few more John-specific cloud shapes. A ghost over there. A beagle puss just overhead. But the more she stares at them, the more she realizes her ability to recognize the shapes is beginning to fade. They start to resemble fluffy, amorphous blobs. Was it all just in her imagination?</p>

    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): And he certainly does appear to suck in this reality.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): And yet, the uneasy feeling is there.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): It’s a vague feeling I’ve had in the 8ack of my mind for a long time, 8ut it really hit me when I was talking to him earlier.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): It’s distur8ing to think a8out that much power 8ottled up in one stupid nerd who’ll never understand it.</p>
    <p class="vriska">VRISKA: What Power are you even talking a8out?</p>
    <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Like, lame Wind Powers?</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): No, I mean...</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): The power to shape reality. Even without intending to.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): Like, just falling 8ackwards into the most insanely overpowered 8ullshit, when the rest of us have to work our asses off for a fraction of that kind of power and relevance.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): He could rewrite everything that ever happened if he wanted. </p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): And he could pro8a8ly even 8end reality to his will in certain ways even if he didn’t have the slightest idea what he was doing, which he usually doesn’t.</p>

The Vriskas have become virtually oblivious to the fact that a strangled juggalo is currently functioning as a throw pillow.

    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): This isn’t good! The point is it’s 8AD!</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): Take it from me, don’t do the shit where you start modeling yourself after some mental image you have of a cooler version of yourself! It just sucks.</p>
    <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Haha, alright, Whatever You Say. :::::::)</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): Ugh. This isn’t going in the direction I was hoping.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): The POINT is, I was so mad at her.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): That happy ghost version of myself, who was free of everything.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): I was pro8a8ly mad 8ecause she got to 8e who she really was, without stressing a8out it, which is something I never felt like I was allowed to have.</p>
    <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Well.</p>

    <p class="vriska">VRISKA: What do you mean.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): I could 8e a 8etter version of myself than I am, 8ut...</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): Then...</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): Who would even 8e around to notice?</p>
    <p class="vriska">VRISKA: I would.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): Oh, yeah. No, I mean, that’s gr8.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): And it’s nice talking to you, and getting stuff off my chest? It’s not what I meant, though.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): I left the people I care most a8out 8ehind.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): What’s the point of 8ecoming your 8est self, if the people most important to you aren’t around to witness it?</p>
    <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Um. Aren’t all your friends Here though?</p>
    <p class="vriska">VRISKA: I know they’re a 8unch of Old Fucks now, 8ut...</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): No, they are. That’s...</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): Not what I mean.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): Sigh. This is hard to explain.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): I guess I mean there’s someone specifically I fell out of touch with, who it feels like I’ll never see again.</p>

    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): On some level I knew she was right. She was happy and honest with herself. And that’s what made her...</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): A version of myself who was actually worthy of someone I cared a8out.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): Don’t get me wrong, we had a nice time for a few years living on that meteor. </p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): It was a good, sta8le pale relationship. 8ut that’s all it was.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): We couldn’t really connect in a deeper way 8ecause I was still... the way I am, I guess?</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): Layers and layers of armor and defenses. </p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): And I had some mysterious feeling that weak ghost version of myself was always meant to form the kind of connection with her that I never could, 8ecause she didn’t have any of that stuff getting in the way.</p>
    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): Which is pro8a8ly why I flipped out at her.</p>

    <p class="vriska">(VRISKA): I don’t know!!!!!!!!</p>

    <p>John’s not late, but Roxy’s run out of things to do except wait for him, which is both cosmically appropriate and annoying. It’s not like she’d been cleaning up for his visit or anything. More just wandering through the house, looking at everything through his hypothetical eyes. Things that changed since he left. Things that stayed the same.</p>
    <p>She figured there’d be some point when they talked face to face again, what with the vast expanse of time laid out in front of them and all. But she’d still been surprised when Jake arranged a “friendly visit” and ended up asking, in hushed tones, if she’d be willing to see John again.</p>
    <p>She’d been open to it from the start, but Jake insisted on this absurd sequence of clandestine meetings to ensure that they’d be “safe” from Jane’s “watchful eye.” It took an exhausting degree of assurance for her to convince them that John could just come over, and that Jane didn’t have the house bugged, and she wasn’t about to come and have him thrown in prison for having the audacity to want to see his own family. Now that the day of the reunion has arrived, Roxy is just ready to get on with it.</p>
    <p>The knock on the door is almost too quiet to hear. She exhales, fluttering her overgrown bangs, and goes to answer.</p>
    <p>He’s even beefier than she remembered, but his posture is turned in on itself like he’s trying to seem small. God, this had better not be another self-flagellation fest. She’s prepared to handle a fair few apologies, but there has always been a cyclicity to John’s contrition, and she can only handle so many self-absorbed attempts at communicating remorse before her head starts feeling like it’ll float away from her body.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: sup john</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: long time no see</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">John smiles at her through his hair as he waves hello: one quick slice of his hand through the air, twisting at the wrist. It comes off as shy and boyish instead of hangdog. A good sign. Maybe her jokey casual approach is the right one. That would be handy, because that’s really the best angle she’s got.</p>
    <p>She mirrors the movement with her own hand and steps aside for him to come in.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="no-indent">He clears his throat and follows her gesture. She walks a little behind him, watching his eyes catch on the things she expected—a coat rack covered in scarves, the wall of family photos, a super badass sculpture some chess guys made for her that John always said was “weirdly sexual, for them.” He looks at it now like it’s something from an almost forgotten dream. Roxy sighs.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">John laughs, and there’s a shadowed flicker of warmth to it. Roxy immediately wants to fan it—to make him laugh for real—but she knows by now that it’s not her job to make him happy. That was something she gave up on years ago. But wanting to? That feeling is still as fresh as it always was.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Roxy shrugs. She’s still working through what she feels about distancing herself from Jane, but John actually isn’t the worst person she could talk to about it. If he’s truly about to be real with her for the first time in forever, she might as well try to meet him halfway.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">She feels a little bit bad cutting him off. This conversational space they’ve carved out for themselves is balanced on a tenuous trust, and she doesn’t want to scare him away. It’s just that she could feel his whole speech gathered up inside him, poised to gush out in a long rote ramble, and it’s frankly just. Some bullshit. She knows more than he does, and she doesn’t need to hear it. She’s not a kid anymore, and she doesn’t have to pretend someone else is right just to keep the peace if she doesn’t want to.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">So much for the jokey, comfortable approach. She tilts her chin up and tries to breathe evenly as she holds eye contact. He’s been looking at her, really looking at her, and she doesn’t want to blink, just in case that shatters it. John doesn’t respond. He just sits there with his mouth hanging open, staring. He blinks a few times, slow, but he’s still focused completely on her. The corners of his still-open mouth pull themselves up helplessly into a smile.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">John’s mouth opens and closes. It seems there’s something stuck in the spokes of his rhetorical tire. Roxy can see the gears struggling to turn in his head. She almost feels bad for him.</p>
    <p>Roxy lets herself take a moment. She doesn’t want to reassure him with lies, to tell him he’s never fucked anything up in his life. But she doesn’t want to twist the knife of blame further into him than it needs to go. So she shrugs, looks her ex-husband in the eyes, and tells him the truth.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">John is quiet. Roxy has more to say, maybe. More things she’s half thought about, but never quite put words to, regarding the paths her life could have taken. This has already been a lot of truth for one moment, though, so she pats John’s knee and walks to the kitchen for some water.</p>
    <p>A glass in each hand, Roxy leans against the counter, breathing. She’s still running on the adrenaline of getting all that out, and the surface of the water trembles with it. She watches the ripples, watches her hands. She wonders if they will ever wrinkle.</p>
    <p>When she sits back down next to John, he takes the glass wordlessly. After a minute of reflective sipping, which she is grateful for, he speaks.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="no-indent">John stretches, scratches the back of his head like an anime love interest, and lets out one mindfucked exhale of a laugh. His features are droopy, his whole body tired from the mental wringer he just went through, but he’s still looking at her for real. Fondness surges through her. Not in a way where she fears the reignition of any romantic feeling. It’s just that she understands him. And he’s starting to understand her. It’s comfortable the way an old t-shirt you thought you lost but discovered in the back of the closet is comfortable. Smells mostly musty, but still enough like home to knock you right on your ass.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Roxy thinks about time and the spirals of choice that hang just outside her periphery, and the vertigo grows. She rolls the word “regret” around in her brain; she feels it on her tongue. John waits.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: i dont think i can regret anything</p>

    <p class="roxy">ROXY: sorry lol im not good at this whole explainin what transpires in my brain thing</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">John shrugs and Roxy gives herself time to think. She remembers how confusing it felt to even approach her identity when this stuff first hit her. There had been some vague truth about the uselessness of rules about how gender should be, but she never quite worked it out.</p>
    <p>She’d stopped thinking about it until she got pregnant—then she had been so afraid that having a baby would confirm some deep truth within her that she’d pushed away, but that it would be too late to back out. That hadn’t happened, and instead there was the strange, all-consuming bodily relief she felt when, somehow, being pregnant had felt right. It was good in the opposite way than she had expected. She hadn’t felt any more womanly than she ever had. It had hit her then that she could think of her body not as specifically female, but as something altogether different. Hers. A flesh machine, shifting pieces around to create a person. Her breasts, which she’d not really known what to do with or how to feel about, suddenly had a specific, practical purpose. It had allowed her to retreat from the concept of gender entirely, grounding herself only in the physical reality of using her body to make another, two heartbeats blending in a rhythm that was nothing but human.</p>
    <p>She does not know how to articulate this to John. It’s convoluted and personal and she isn’t sure she can do the overwhelming goodness of it justice. But then, Harry Anderson is his, too, so she knows she has to try.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: idk this life ive been livin gave me harry anderson</p>

    <p class="roxy">ROXY: i...</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Touching those huge, inarticulate thoughts with words feels bigger than she expected, and tears prick at the backs of her eyes. She shakes her head and laughs before John can start crying, too.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: but lmao john were just adults</p>

    <p class="no-indent">They both smile, and it somehow felt more real and warm than it was before. Maybe the cushion of years and lack of pressure makes it so, but she doesn’t question it too closely. She doesn’t want to go back to where she’d been with him, but knowing they’d both been there, together, feels like enough.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="no-indent">John nods, and as he opens his mouth to speak, the door opens.</p>
    <p>Harry Anderson looks at the two of them all teary and laughing and hikes his bag higher on his shoulder, shifting his weight. Roxy sees a muscle tighten in his jaw. Her beautiful, smart boy. She wants to run over and hug him, to protect him from the possibility of pain at talking to his father, but she doesn’t. She knows how much he’s wanted this, no matter how much he jokes about it.</p>
    <p>She looks back at John, and sees her own awe mirrored in his face. She wills him not to cry, not to fall back on his self-imposed suffering and blame loop. Something about the last hour must have done the trick, though. John stands up, brushes his hands on his jeans, and walks, back straight, toward his son.</p>

Though they’re high-ranking members of the resistance, they aren’t decked out in the full military regalia associated with their positions. They’re in camo fatigues, Dave sporting a patchwork of bright and dark reds, Jade in black and grays. This is the designated attire for those on scouting and reconnaissance missions, which is the nature of their current expedition. </p>
    <p>The orders came from Commander Vantas himself. This underdeveloped part of the border, mostly uninhabited for many miles, was unspeakably critical to the rebellion, according to the commander. When pressed on it, he’d claim the reasons needed to remain classified for now. Dave and Jade suspect the real reason is that Karkat can’t bear to put them in harm’s way, risking their Heroic deaths. But they’ve decided to do him the professional courtesy of believing his story. The way they see it, he’s finally earned a little respect by now. Besides, there’s some fun to be had out here, away from the fog of war. Just like the good old days, during their archaeological expeditions in search of Shitty Liberties. </p>
    <p>They fly side by side just above the thick jungle canopy, sweeping the horizon with sharp eyes.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jade">JADE: i think i see another one!</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: oh snap</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dave squints. Sure enough, there does appear to be a large, rusted arm holding a torch, blurred by JPEG artifacts and covered in vines, poking out just above the canopy. It’s two or three miles off to the west. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: youre right</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: another shitty liberty</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: good eye jade </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dave takes a picture with his phone, then updates his report containing a comprehensive accounting of the locations of every ancient Statue of Liberty his alternate-timeline adult self once distributed all over this world as some sort of ironic, avant-garde goof. He’s spent a lot of time on Earth C wondering when adult-Dave got around to doing which specific legendary exploits in the pre-flood period of this planet when it was in the old solar system. So much time, in fact, that he turned into an adult-Dave himself. Was he the age he is now when he scattered these Liberties in one of the boldest postmodernist endeavors in human history? The thought is sobering. He can’t help but feel how appropriate it is that about five thousand years later, his work is being curated and appreciated by yet another adult-Dave. Who better for the task?</p>
    <p>Jade readies another tactical bundle to be deployed inside the distant Liberty. It includes an efficient pack of captchalogue cards containing tracking technology, military equipment, and powerful explosives. In the event this region becomes another front of the war, the commander wants as many Shitty Liberties as possible seeded with provisions useful to the rebellion, including the ability to detonate them at any time, so that they may serve as traps. Dave wonders if his other self ever imagined they’d be used this way. He’s sure adult-Dave would have approved, being a fellow freedom fighter himself. It’s too perfect, actually. Deploying a bunch of Shitty Liberties as bombs in the service of a kind of liberty that is entirely un-shitty. It makes him wonder if his other self on some level knew they would be used for this purpose one day. The thought of his double’s selfless sacrifices against clown tyranny makes him feel so proud, he wipes away a small tear forming at the edge of his eye. </p>
    <p>Old age has made him emotional. It didn’t used to be like this. Gotta keep it together, he thinks. Focus on the mission.</p>
    <p>Then, he notices something. Just below him, to the east a bit. A lumpy part of the jungle where the canopy bulges upward slightly in an uneven, somewhat angular way. It suggests a rigid structure beneath the overgrowth. Something man-made. Another Liberty, perhaps? No, this structure is different, more compact. More likely a ruined building from an ancient Earth city. It seems to call to him.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: yo jade</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: why dont you go ahead and rig that liberty ill be right there</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i wanna check something out down here first</p>
    <p class="jade">JADE: what is it?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: idk probably nothing</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: some ancient bullshit tucked away in the fucking jungle</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: doesnt hurt to be thorough</p>
    <p class="jade">JADE: ok dave</p>
    <p class="jade">JADE: be careful!</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah</p>
    <p class="jade">JADE: i love you</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i love you too</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jade swoops closer, gives him a kiss, then spins around and flies off to the distant Shitty Liberty. Dave watches his wife go, her tail protruding through the rear of her camo pants, swishing back and forth with a sense of unrestrained affection for her husband. He’s a lucky man, he tells himself. He knows he is. Before any decades-old doubts can resurface to haunt him, he dives through the canopy in search of the ruins. Those reservations, the tense feelings in his chest, that’s all in the past for him. He loves his beautiful, doggy wife more than anything in the world, and that’s all there is to say on the matter.</p>
    <p>The ruins are so overgrown with vines and the thick trunks of creeping trees, he can’t make out the shape of the building. He can barely see an inch of exposed surface, but something is clearly there. He flies around the perimeter, pushing leaves and branches out of his way. Here’s something. An old window, grand in design, but broken, busted in by a huge branch that extends deep inside from years of growth. </p>
    <p>It’s dark inside, hot and musty. He activates a small, military-issue flashlight. Bugs scatter and fly about. He scans the boundaries of the room, shining the light around. There are unrecognizably ancient, moldy paintings in frames hanging on the wall. And yet the wall seems to have no corners. He knows what this room is. He’s seen it before in films, under much better repair than this.</p>
    <p>He’s standing in the Oval Office of the White House. Plant life is covering everything, but all the fixtures are there. Moss is consuming the big desk. That flowering mass of thorny vines is where the couches would be. And over there... is something he doesn’t quite recognize. It doesn’t seem to fit in. He steps closer to investigate, wiping away at the layers of moss and dirt to reveal a surface he most certainly does recognize. It’s a transportalizer. </p>
    <p>Dave doesn’t waste any time. You don’t find something like this in the Oval Office and start agonizing over whether or not to use it. He steps on the platform, and in a blink his surroundings are completely different. The centuries of overgrowth are gone, and he appears to be in some sort of crypt, boxed in by walls of smooth, golden stone. At the far side of the room, something is hanging on the wall, encased in a sort of display. It’s a mounted god tier costume, about the size an adult male would wear. He recognizes the symbol. It’s the same one Jake used to wear when they were teens. It is the symbol for Hope. </p>
    <p>He steps toward the costume, hears a “click” under his shoes. He looks down and discovers he’s standing on a large button, which has just become illuminated under the pressure of his feet. The button bears a strange, angular symbol he doesn’t recognize, but before he can study it, something directly in front of him draws his attention. Thousands of bright particles swarm from an unseen origin and coalesce into a solid, luminous figure in the shape of a tall man. The radiance of the holographic image diminishes to reveal a man in a suit, with a strikingly recognizable face. Dave draws in a sharp breath and clutches at his chest. </p>

    <p class="obama">OBAMA: You see, Dave. No one can really see the big picture. </p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: That’s what real leadership is all about. Looking at the big picture, seeing the long road ahead, making the hard choices for the greatest good. </p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Not just decisions that lead to a better tomorrow, or to make sure the next year is better than the last. Or even the next decade.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: You have to think about the next century, the next millennium.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Sometimes, you may even have to leave people wondering if you’ve forsaken them entirely, because your real duty is to concern yourself with the final destination of the planet. To make sure it stays safe along the hard journey and ends up being the best home it can be for both the human race and the many newcomers to our world.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Doing the right thing often means walking a long and lonely road, Dave.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: But I’m guessing you’ve already figured this out.</p>

    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Oh, I certainly died, Dave. </p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Just not when they say I did. </p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Like I said, I was just answering the call. </p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Other brave heroes like you stepped in to fill the void I left behind. As I knew you all would.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: And some say the death of those heroes was in vain, or a waste, since the human race was wiped out anyway. Just like they say my supposed death was a waste, a loss that humanity couldn’t endure.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: But they were wrong. </p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Those heroes were fighting for something. Even if all you manage to accomplish is leaving behind a legacy to inspire others in the future who need that Hope to go on. Even if one of those in the future you end up inspiring is an alternate history version of yourself, Dave.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Haven’t you been improved by the knowledge of what you grew up to be in my time? Can you really say you’d be what you are today without the memory of him?</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Or the memory of me, for that matter?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dave considers the question seriously. He’s transfixed by Obama’s kind gaze and can’t seem to look away. There are times when he feels relieved by the lifestyle decision he made as a kid to wear a pair of aviator sunglasses at all times, no matter what.</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: sorry if this is nosy but if you didnt die when you disappeared then how did you die</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Most of that is classified, Dave.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Rest assured, it was a Heroic death that took place many years after my disappearance, upon which rested the fate of Paradox Space itself.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: There were loose ends to tie up. Baggage from my distant past. You know how it is. Troubles from your childhood tend to follow you. Even after you move into the White House. Believe me.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: heh yeah i guess so</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: what happened to you as a kid</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: or is that classified too</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: No, it’s not classified. Because I never even told the government about it.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Can’t classify what you don’t know.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: damn</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: When I was a boy living in Hawaii, on my thirteenth birthday I was visited by a mysterious stranger.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: He was an older man with a mustache. Kind of a corny, old-fashioned, adventuring type. He tried to convince me we were related. Of course, I thought he was full of shit.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: To this day, I’m not sure about that. Maybe he was. I didn’t think much of his tall tale at the time, but what did pique my interest was his story.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: He was voyaging all over the Pacific looking for a mysterious island, which supposedly had all the answers he’d spent his whole life searching for. </p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: During his travels, he set up outposts all over the ocean to help with his search. Such as one near where I lived as a boy. The outpost had a laboratory, an archeological dig site, a network of underground tunnels, the works.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: One time, I snuck in there and did some exploration of my own. Somewhere in the maze of underground ruins, I found a transporter pad, just like the one that brought you here.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: It sent me to a new realm. A place they called the Medium. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dave does his best not to show it, but his heart is racing faster with every word Obama says. His mind races too, with more thoughts than he can keep track of. Thoughts of affirmation, exhilaration. i knew it... i knew it! his brain repeats to itself. The sense of vindication is indescribable. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Others were there. Kids my age. I made friends that lasted a lifetime.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Over the years, I would return there now and then, when I felt I was needed.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: I made one final trip there after serving my terms in office. As I said, I kept an eye on Earth events. But I knew I could never return. Not with the work that still needed to be done.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: But before my Heroic death, I made sure to have my affairs in order, to fulfill certain cosmic necessities of the future. Such as our meeting here today, Dave.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: holy shit</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: I captchalogued a ghost imprint of my brain. You remember how to do that, don’t you?</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: I stored the imprint in this holographic projection device. </p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: You see, Dave, it was critical that I had a chance to speak with you. But only when the time was right. Only once you had made it all this way, standing ready to defend the future of Earth C.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Tears are welling up in the corners of Dave’s eyes. There go the fucking waterworks again. He says another quiet prayer of gratitude for the shades John gave him. He’s got to keep it together. He tells himself there’s nothing wrong with crying. Of course there isn’t. Just... not in front of Obama. He’s GOT to keep it together. He sniffs in deeply, with a theatrical stoicism, and crosses his arms. But on his exhale, a small, choked sob escapes. He seals his lips tight, but his mouth quivers and puckers under the impossible pressures of restraint.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: I know what you’re going through. There’s a lot to be emotional about in these trying times.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Obama waves his hand toward a wall, and a secret compartment opens up with the traditional stone-grinding noises to be heard in any crypt worth exploring. He leads the way into a dark corridor. They walk for some time, only one pair of solid feet making audible footsteps that echo far ahead into the darkness. The light from Obama himself serves as Dave’s torch. Soon, he feels calm enough to continue the conversation.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">He’s hyperventilating now but catches himself. He has to calm down. This is no way to behave in front of a president. He collects himself, starts breathing steadily, and looks up.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: mr president </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: can you keep a secret</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Yes I can, Dave. </p>

    <p class="no-indent">Obama purses his lips in that trademark way of his—thoughtful, serious, contemplative. He nods slowly, letting the silence grow, as if considering precisely how to deliver the most perfect arrangement of words any man has uttered in human history.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Over the course of our lives, we all tend to believe we’re a lot of different things.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: One year, you’re this. Another, you’re that. Later in life, you start pushing forty, and start worrying you’ve been believing the wrong thing about yourself the whole time.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: I’ve had my share of doubts about all that, just like any other man.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: And I’ve had plenty of the same kind of struggles as you, Dave.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: wait</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: you...  </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Obama nods, smiles wistfully. Dave arches his eyebrows high above his shades. They stare at each other, and in the look they exchange, they seem to say all that needs to be said between two grown men on the matter.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Identity, sexuality, gender, all that stuff is about as illusory as I am, standing before you here.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Is this the real me? Who can really say.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Depends on what real means, or what I even mean when I say “me.”</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: For that matter, are you even the real you?</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Haven’t you been asking yourself that question one way or another all your life?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Believing is the key to understanding the truth underlying the words, the truth underlying the ideas they represent, and the truth underlying who we are as individuals.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: The power of belief, the power of Hope, that’s what endows that which is intangible, ephemeral, or uncertain with a sense of reality.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: It brings focus to the insubstantial, the mirages of the mind, the multiplicity of what is possible, of what could be, and isolates it—concentrates it—to turn it into that which is.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: And the result of that, Dave, is what we call truth.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dave is still crying, but he doesn’t care anymore. The tears are flowing down his face, but he won’t look away. He’s perfectly unashamed of his vulnerability at this moment. The only thing he knows is he needs to listen carefully to every precious syllable. To listen with his ears, his heart, his entire being. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: The truth of oneself can be very specific, if one wills it to be.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Statements such as, I am gay, I am straight, I am a man, I am a woman, these are statements about an individual that gain strength through the power of belief we invest in them.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: But there is another more generalized truth about a person that can emerge when such conviction is absent. When the partitions of the mind dissolve, and the boundaries between everything you are now and everything you might have become begin to fade away.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: oh</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: are you saying thats not what happened</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: I’m saying you know as well as I that it’s awfully hard to pin down exactly what happened to whom, depending on which frame of reference we might be talking about.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: wow</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: so like... he...  </p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: I learned a lot from him.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Met up with him as a young man, as I was just beginning to explore the wonders of my session.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: He taught me about many things. Combat, philosophy, life, love...  </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: love???</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: hold on are you saying</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: that...  </p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Now, Dave. I can’t go around disclosing everything under the sun. Plenty of this is still under the umbrella of executive privilege. </p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Loose lips sink ships, as they say.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Obama winks again. Dave has actually lost track of how many times he’s winked so far.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: right right</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: so... somehow he met you and uh</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: trained you and stuff</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: and talked about the ultimate self</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i remember my dirk would go off the deep end about that stuff sometimes</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: and maybe it made him fucking snap because then he just offed himself and that was that</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: but rose used to talk about it too</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: probably even more</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: but one day she just stopped and never mentioned it again</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: do you know what like</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: happened to her</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: She’s settled happily into the specific. That’s her path now.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: All of you have embraced that life, in this safely sequestered version of planet Earth.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: All of you until now, Dave.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: This is why you’re here.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: I believe you’re ready to wake up.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: ...  </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dave realizes suddenly that they’ve stopped at a dead end of the passage. Obama holds up his arm and points his open palm toward the wall. The wall lifts with the comforting sound of ancient stones grinding against each other. The sliding panel reveals a recess, and in the recess stands a robot. It’s a gleaming, polished silver replica of Dave, but without shades. It stands totally still, unpowered. Dave struggles to make sense of what he’s looking at. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Now, look.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: A human body, even one that’s been elevated to god tier status, cannot withstand the stresses put on it by the awesome power of the Ultimate Self. </p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: You’d quickly become sick and wither away. We can’t have that.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: So before I died, I made sure to create this brand-new body for you.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: I have to admit, it’s some of my finest work. A real beauty. </p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: It should serve you well in your new life. A life where the world will need you more than ever, Dave.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Not only this world, but the future of reality.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: If this sounds confusing, don’t worry. You’ll understand everything once I help you ascend.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: So what do you say? At the end of the day, this is a choice that belongs to you.</p>
    <p class="obama">OBAMA: Are you ready to accept your destiny, Dave Strider?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">It finally catches up with him, what’s taking place here. Dave is sobbing loudly now, beside himself with feelings of joy, a sort of existential relief, and a true sense of purpose. He takes only a moment to decide. Not to weigh the merits of decision. He understands now that the decision was already made the second he first laid eyes on the former president. He pauses only to savor this perfect moment.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: yes</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: absolutely</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i have never been more ready for anything in my life mr president</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Obama nods once, curtly, and his smile dissolves into a serious look as he closes his eyes. He extends his arm and slowly pushes his hand through Dave’s forehead. The energy from the dense lightform crackles and sends waves through the air like ripples through a pond. It happens suddenly, a shock of white light completely enveloping his and Dave’s bodies, intense bands and lashes of pure Hope radiating from their silhouettes. </p>
    <p>Dave’s eyes widen, his mouth opens as if to scream, but he doesn’t make a sound. Infinite experience flows through his consciousness, an unimpeded torrent of raw potentiality. He sees everything. The roads not taken, the lives not lived, the thoughts, desires, fears all unacted upon. The Doomed Daves, the Davesprites, the Davepetas, life with Jade, life with Karkat, life with both, life with neither. It’s like soaring through the clouds at supersonic speed, too quickly to make out the shape of any single puffy nimbus, like a breakneck jaunt through Skaia. Huge clouds rushing by, small ones, clouds with visions, empty clouds, white clouds, then a great dark one. And then, the briefest possible glimpses—most too fleeting to be noticed—of Dirk.</p>
    <p>And then, nothing. It all stops abruptly, and Dave collapses to the ground, dead.</p>
    <p>Obama is holding his hand up, and floating just above his palm is Dave’s ascended essence. It flickers wildly in his hand like a little kernelsprite. Obama holds it up to his face and blows it away like dandelion fluff. It floats lazily into the chest of the robot, and with that, Obama disappears, leaving the corridor in total darkness and silence.</p>
    <p>Seconds pass. And then a minute. </p>
    <p>And then, time seems to stop altogether. As if the aspect itself has suspended its forward motion, bowing before the unprecedented transformation taking place. It defers to its greatest knight, risen anew.</p>
    <p>With a deep, reverberating electric hum, the robot’s eyes light up, deep red, bright enough to light up the entire passage. Its face comes to life. Its mouth, oddly pliable for a metal surface, begins to smile a little. And then, very broadly.</p>
    <p>The robot steps out of its recess and points its head downward, the searing red beams from its eyes spotlighting Dave’s crumpled torso. The robot—Davebot—shakes his head slowly. The doubts, the confusion, the insecurities of the man lying here all died along with his body. Davebot smoothly reaches down, lifts the shades off the corpse, and puts them on his face.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md" style="margin-bottom:0">
    <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: its about fuckin time</p>

Fluorescent lights, diaphanous curtains, everything crisp and clean. </p>
    <p>A hospital? </p>
    <p>Wait, this doesn’t seem right, she thinks. When she closed her eyes, she was dramatically lingering about her bedroom at home. She’d just taken a handful of pills, and said goodbye to... </p>

    <p class="no-indent">Rose considers this for a very long time, eyes fixed on the window at the other end of the room. The night is dying behind the thin, pale curtain. She can barely see the moon.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I feel... </p>

    <p class="no-indent">Rose shuts her eyes and takes a deep breath. For some reason, she’s never felt so relieved in her life. She thinks about what she was about to send John off to do, and her feelings of grim urgency surrounding the matter. And yet, for the life of her, she can’t bring herself to care about whatever it was she felt was so direly important about his decision. All that matters to her now is that he’s safe, in good health, and spending time with those he cares about. And apparently, due to a perfectly inexplicable turn of events, so is she.</p>
    <p>The door to the room creaks open, and in slips a smiling carapacian in blue scrubs. Rose listens to Kanaya ask fretful questions about her condition. The nurse responds by tapping her clipboard in a musical rhythm.</p>
    <p>Rose opens her eyes. She stares at the knob of her wrist and frowns. She’s not sure why this sensation should be concerning. It’s not like her memory is slipping away. She remembers the conversation she had with John this morning quite clearly. As she does the previous years of declining health, and troubled, obsessive thoughts about canon, dissipation, and other such abstractions. What’s slipping away instead is the feeling that any of it mattered at all. Was she insane to be so consumed by such lofty concerns, and is she only beginning to experience clarity today, for the first time in ages? </p>
    <p>When the nurse leaves, Kanaya puts a hand over the wrist that she is so preoccupied with.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Kanaya laughs again. Gaily this time, as if some terrible, dark weight has been lifted from her shoulders. She lets out a thin, shaky breath afterward. It’s like the noise fills the room back up with oxygen. Rose hadn’t realized that she’d held her breath at all; the shadow hanging over Kanaya’s thoughts was hanging over hers as well. But now that she’s said it aloud, the darkness dissipates without ever materializing into its true shape. </p>
    <p>Rose uses the hem of her hospital gown to wipe the tears off Kanaya’s face.</p>

The fierce lights of war on the horizon stain the sunset in unnatural hues: ultraviolet pigments of red and purple slash through the atmosphere in harsh, jagged strokes. The cracks in the sky above are a diseased shade of green, bright bolts receding like lightning in a storm. Dead-Jade, host to the cherub’s spirit, floats at the apex of the tower. The blitzkrieg above makes a kaleidoscope of color between the black stripes on her tights.</p>
    <p>Aradia glides up to meet her, having left Sollux on the balcony. Above, in the sky, a hole has opened up. One so big it fills the entire radius of her vision.</p>

    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: just a little bit</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: yes, you would think so.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: lesser beings have so much trouble perceiving divinity in the uncanny.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: lesser? </p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: you have proven yourself a valuable servant, and pleasant company.</p>

    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: it could always be worse i suppose</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: you said that we were the “lucky ones” if i recall correctly</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: all in this place are luckier than those who are not, in a certain way.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: but what way is that</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: the people on this planet seem so...  </p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: well i dont want to be mean</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: but is that the paradox of living in a utopia</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: when everything is perfect and your every need is met </p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: is it natural for people to start crossing blades at imaginary enemies</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: i doubt that’s what troubles you about this world.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: oh?</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: what you’ve described is a state of empirical ennui resulting from the material circumstances here.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: but the material circumstances of this world have no objective existential value.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: this world, unlike the canonical horrors from which it is hermetically insulated, will always fail to meet the combined criteria for truth, relevance, and essentiality that would endow this realm with any real gravity. </p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: its own naturally occurring supply of gravity, rather than the artificial supply i have given it.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: as such, what transpires here is characterized by experiential frivolity.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: physically, it is cordoned off by the black hole’s event horizon. it is safe. untouchable.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: inescapable.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: that sounds ominous</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: it cannot be ominous because it cannot truly be anything with tangible significance.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: one could describe it as a phantasmal projection confined within my horizon.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: it was created by a choice that made it possible for that horizon to expand infinitely, to consume infinitely.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: and since that choice could not coexist with canon events, this place manifested here to support its consequences.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: if this world were capable of anything either essential, relevant, or true in some stable combination, then it would perpetuate a corrosive paradox.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: as such, insulation from what is out there, and the inescapable well it rests in, is what protects all it holds inside.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: and since i am the embodiment of the black hole in which it rests,</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: i am the one protecting this world.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: why?</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: if its so irrelevant whats the point</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: it is simply my duty to defend the innocent from destruction, degradation, and dissolution.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: but there is more to consider than just my nature.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: as it happens, this projection within me serves as a stable conceptual foothold from which i can sense and resist another growing threat which is determined to jeopardize the canonical plane of reality.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: ah yes the prince</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: i still have no idea who he is</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: not that i doubt you really</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: we had a prince who was a huge jerk who destroyed everything he touched </p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: the prince i am referring to electively removed himself from this reality in order to strategically consolidate his power.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: he cannot threaten this world. and yet by sequestering himself elsewhere, has become infinitely more dangerous.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: what makes him so dangerous</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: i mean</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: what exactly is it he can do which is more destructive than what i was seeing just before i came here?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">The cherub makes a rare physical gesture with her hands to begin framing her next statements. Aradia notes this and strives to listen more closely. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: physical destruction is one thing.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: obliteration of the entire canvas for all of reality over a given cosmic span is another.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: and yet there are even more insidious forms of destruction and subversion of life to consider.</p>

    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: but im also very curious!</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: can you try me?</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: of course.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: let’s begin by examining the nature of a story.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: ok</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: it will be easier to do this if we have an example of a story to discuss. </p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: some stories are impossibly long. but others can be quite short.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: some can even be a few words. </p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: what’s your favorite story?</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: my favorite?</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: um</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: i dont know how to answer that really</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: don’t you like stories?</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: of course i do!</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: but do you mean like</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: a book? a movie?</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: anything.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: ummm</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: pick literally any example you can think of.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: ok</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: theres a famous religious story from my planet</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: about someone called the signless</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: who i guess turned out to be my friends ancestor which was weird</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: but thats beside the point</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: yes, i know of the tale.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: how would you tell his story, if you were trying to be as brief as possible?</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: well</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: a religious martyr attempted to lead a rebellion but he was killed in a horrible way and shouted a very loud rude word in the process</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: that’s good. </p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: try making it shorter though.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: ok</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: a martyr tried to rebel but he was killed horribly and then shouted a rude word</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: shorter.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: wow</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: um...</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: a martyr rebelled but died and shouted rudely?</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: shorter.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: oof</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: ok hows this</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: a martyr died and said fuck</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: perfect.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: what is the point of this</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: to establish an extremely short narrative for certain illustrative purposes.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: i’m going to repeat your story to you, and i want you to listen carefully.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: a martyr died and said fuck.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: ok i listened</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: thats definitely the short story i just said</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: yes.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: now i’m going to repeat the story, but change the way i say it very slightly.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: listen again carefully.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: ...</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: <span class="calliope-dead-story type-rg type-sm--md">a martyr died and said fuck.</span></p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: hmm</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: yes that was a little different</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: im not sure that i could describe how though it was pretty subtle</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: yes.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: you noticed because i told you to pay attention for a difference.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: you noticed because you were alert to the fact that there was even something to notice at all.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: and if you had not been alert to the fact that something could be different about the nature of the voice telling your story, or to the fact that such differences had a certain significance, you likely would not have noticed.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: i see</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: yes i think youre right</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: but now imagine that i told your story in exactly that way. that i said,</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: <span class="calliope-dead-story type-rg type-sm--md">a martyr died and said fuck.</span></p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: but it was the first time you ever heard that story.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: also imagine you couldn’t see me and didn’t even know i existed.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: and imagine you couldn’t even hear the story i just told with your ears.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: it simply entered your awareness in some other manner, in a way that was impersonal. almost like one of your own thoughts speaking to you.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: ok</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: picture that this is all you have ever known of this story. the only way it would ever occur to you that the story could be understood by another.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: and then, one day, you meet me.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: you look me up and down, and regard me as the discrete, specific individual that i am.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: and i decide to tell you this story again, using my own voice.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: and it sounds exactly like this:</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: a martyr died and said fuck.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: huh...</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: does this change the way you perceive the story you were originally familiar with?</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: i guess a little bit</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: it’s certainly a different way of hearing it</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: but at least you didnt change any words so i guess its not all that different</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: exactly.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: i didn’t change any words.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: but then, it was a very short story i told, wasn’t it?</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: sure was</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: now imagine it was much longer, and that was only the first line.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: thats easy to imagine</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: his was a long story</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: quite true.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: a story as short as the one we’ve been using cannot accomplish much when it comes to guiding and manipulating one’s awareness and emotions.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: it is compact, ostensibly commanding a simple and meditative moment of reflection, as a short poem might.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: the narrative it delivers is freighted with inference. it is a pattern imprinted upon the imagination consisting solely of cognitive dark matter, or a sort of notional negative space.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: but longer stories have the power to draw consciousness into them. they possess arresting and hypnotic qualities which can be used by their tellers to alter the awareness of the listener.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: again, i’d like you to imagine this is the only way you’ve ever known this story.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: but then it continues...</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: <span class="calliope-dead-story type-rg type-sm--md">a martyr died and said fuck.</span></p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: <span class="calliope-dead-story type-rg type-sm--md">his final howl of profanity reverberated through the ages.</span></p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: <span class="calliope-dead-story type-rg type-sm--md">it inspired his devotees during the darkest times of a brutal regime.</span></p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: <span class="calliope-dead-story type-rg type-sm--md">his lessons were guarded, kept secret, espoused in the shadows of tyranny.</span></p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: <span class="calliope-dead-story type-rg type-sm--md">a vision of peace would inspire those who’d never conceived of it.</span></p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: <span class="calliope-dead-story type-rg type-sm--md">and though his death was gruesome, it opened the world to a feeling of hope.</span></p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: <span class="calliope-dead-story type-rg type-sm--md">this hope echoed through the ages.</span></p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: <span class="calliope-dead-story type-rg type-sm--md">it gave his disciples the strength to persist as they perished in droves.</span></p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: <span class="calliope-dead-story type-rg type-sm--md">it was the only light to shine on a dark planet for millions of sweeps.</span></p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: <span class="calliope-dead-story type-rg type-sm--md">and if you are one so devoted to his teachings, who sees truth in his words,</span></p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: <span class="calliope-dead-story type-rg type-sm--md">it may be said with great authority that</span> you are wrong.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: you are foolish to believe his lies. his martyrdom is false, his sacrifice hollow.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: repent for your adherence to this illusion now, and perhaps leniency will be your reward.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: 0_0</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: what just happened there</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: i brought to your attention that the story you were listening to had a speaker with a specific identity.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: and where there is an identity, there can also be an agenda.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: i gained the power to bend your consciousness to become more amenable to my narrative agenda by lulling you into a more receptive state through the established rhythm of the story’s telling.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: this was only possible because you were not initially questioning the identity of the teller, or even considering that there was an identity to consider.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: i guess youre right</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: hence, we may view any story as speakerless, or spoken, so as to bring designations to the duality i have just presented.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: a story may remain speakerless from the beginning until the end, offering no reason for its listener to ever imagine it is of the spoken sort.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: it can also be spoken from the beginning, which is an up-front announcement to the listener that it carries the perspective of an individual.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: but a spoken story may also disguise itself as one that is speakerless, as mine just did.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: the speaker may reveal herself well after speakerless conditions have been established. </p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: and then one may ask. was it spoken by that individual all along while remaining masked, or has the speaker suddenly intervened to command a heretofore speakerless tale?</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: i dont...</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: well in your case</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: it certainly did seem like you were the one speaking all along</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: but using different voices</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: that’s true. </p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: not all situations are like the one i just demonstrated though.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: for as long as the hypothetical speaker of a speakerless story remains masked, then it is true that the story could be seen as either speakerless or spoken. both are true, as well as neither. </p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: it is best seen as a null factor, until there is a departure.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: once a hidden speaker becomes unmasked, then retroactively the story may be considered spoken all along.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: and so too do we retroactively change how we regard what has already been spoken.</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: yeah</p>

    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: yes.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: and so there is a very dangerous and destructive quality to these nebulous forces which i have gone to some lengths to demonstrate for you here.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: not everyone who is affected by these forces is fit to fully grasp their insidious qualities, or the sense of urgency that they must be resisted with.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">JADE: this is the sort of corruption i now must dedicate my existence in this new body to ending once and for all.</p>

    <p>A spaceship tears across a starfield at warp speed. Each dot of distant light stretches to become a spear, hurtling in the opposite direction of the craft faster than any photon ever fired from its surface. The ship was brand-new when it departed from Earth C, and it doesn’t look a day older now, even though many hundreds of days have passed. It seems to be built to look somewhat like a shark, by a designer who wasn’t totally sure how many fins a shark hard, nor where exactly to stick them on the beast’s body.</p>
    <p>Inside, a hot iron smooths the fabric of an elaborate garment, releasing a gentle hiss of steam. At a glance, it looks like the top to a god tier costume. But it clearly isn’t standard issue. This one is more stylish, more ornate, more... anime? Sometimes one finds there simply isn’t another word that will do to describe some sick gear. The iron eases the wrinkles out of the icon emblazoned on its chest—a hot-pink heart, bisected vertically, hollow in one half. A shiny, graceful metal hand puts the iron down, removes the garment from the ironing board, and reaches for the pantaloons.</p>
    <p>She isn’t even sure how he gets these things so wrinkly. Perhaps it’s all the time he spends training in the hypergravity chamber, assuming they’ve got one of those onboard. Then again, there are times when he seems so high-strung, he could wrinkle a good anime costume sitting perfectly still in an armchair.</p>
    <p>She drapes the pantaloons over the board, then pauses to reach for the candy bowl nearby. She doesn’t actually need to eat anymore. The entire concept of eating has been upended for her. It’s not about sustenance, or even necessarily about enjoying certain flavors. It’s more about staying connected to a vestigial habit reminding her of the humanity she’s been forced to abandon.</p>
    <p>Not just any kind of candy would cut it. The sensors on her metal tongue are very particular. Weaker than taste buds and arranged differently. These would taste like some combination of battery acid and wasabi to a human tongue. But to her the flavor is mild, exotic, certainly worth snacking on to pass the time. Human teeth wouldn’t stand a chance of cracking these, but hers make short work of turning the candy into fine gravel. One of her more reckless shipmates chipped a tooth trying one, despite repeated warnings to stay away from the stuff.</p>
    <p>The iron hits a snag on the pantaloons, putting an awkward crease in the ridiculous, billowing fabric. She curses and puts the iron down. She decides “laundry day” is officially over. The guy can just wear a wrinkly pair of pants today for all she cares. It’s not like he has an audience, despite his best efforts to behave as if he did all the time. She doesn’t really enjoy doing laundry or ironing silly anime ensembles, and she considers herself nobody’s maid. It’s just that there hasn’t been much to do on this ship.</p>
    <p>It’s not like the old days of her long-range interstellar travels. That halcyon period riding a meteor across the abyss for years, with an atmosphere of camaraderie, feelings of optimism—a rewardingly transformative period in everyone’s young life. She guesses this is just what things feel like on a long journey when you’re older, and with a much smaller crew. </p>
    <p>She turns off the iron, then wanders off down a corridor. It’s nothing like the meteor in here. Bright, futuristic. Skaianet does build a lovely ship, she has to admit. She turns a corner, and her foot kicks something. It’s a stray ruby slipper. The other is about ten feet away, down the hall. No sign of their owner anywhere. She’d sigh, except she doesn’t breathe anymore. She doesn’t consider herself to be <em>her</em> maid either, but she reaches down to pick up the slippers nonetheless.</p>
    <p>She enters a room central to the ship, one that she visits now and then, possibly for sentimental reasons. Or maybe it’s just to creep herself out. Situated near the wall is something that looks like a rather elegantly designed iron lung. It’s mostly made of glass, with polished silver trim around the sides and base. There’s a digital monitor on the wall. She approaches and places her hands on the glass with a faint metal clink.</p>
    <p>She used to live in this body. She’s dressed in the same clothes she was wearing the day she slipped into the coma. A special tiara replaces her typical hairband, lined with blinking transmitters. The device beams her awareness directly into her current mechanical avatar. She presumes it utilizes the same technology that Jade’s grandfather once used to build a dreambot for her, which functioned similarly.</p>
    <p>She knows she’ll never be able to inhabit this sleeping body again. She honestly can’t decide whether that makes her feel sad or relieved. She ponders the future of her old body. Will it all work as planned? She has to believe it will. It is the only path to achieve permanence for these tenuous bodily accommodations.</p>
    <p>A jarring sound snaps her out of her reverie. It’s an alert, beeping urgently from the cockpit. The robot leaves her entombed living body and runs quickly through the winding corridors. She sits down at the helm and examines the monitor.</p>
    <p>A new planet is within sensor range. She studies the millions of statistics all pouring in at once. Her pupil-less eyes take them all in simultaneously, her head needing only to move a quarter inch from side to side to pan her vision across the data. It’s an M-Class planet. The right size, right age, right distance from the sun. There’s no advanced life yet. It’s exactly what they’ve been looking for all these years. </p>
    <p>Her heart doesn’t beat any faster, because its pace is regulated by an internal chip. She consciously accelerates it anyway. It’s been a long time since she’s had the occasion to feel exhilarated. She’s missed the sensation of the old flesh-ticker acting of its own accord.</p>
    <p>The thoughts in her powerful brain race. What will they name the planet? How long will it take for the ship to arrive? Once the new race has established an advanced enough civilization thousands of years from now, who will the lucky kids be? The ones who get the chance to play what will arguably be the most important session in the history of <em>Sburb</em>?</p>
    <p>She holds her thoughts. They can wait, and there’s much to discuss. She taps a button, and lowers her head a little closer to a mic on the panel. </p>

    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: THANK YOU DAVE. THAT WAS HEARTWARMING AND NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT EMBARRASSING. CONSIDER MY HONOR UNDENIABLY DEFENDED.</p>
    <p class="jade">JADE: actually karkat its more like youre the one defending HIS honor</p>
    <p class="jade">JADE: thats sooooo cute.... a knight whiteknighting for another knight</p>

    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WHAT THE FUCK IS A HUSBAND?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: er</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dave un-pokes his finger from Karkat’s cheek and tries to shimmy some space between them on the couch, but there’s nowhere to go. Karkat is sandwiched between him and Jade, who is reaching out to put two fingers of her own at the center of his chest. She bounces them there a few times, enjoying the way troll skin is just a bit thicker than human skin, taut like the membrane over a poorly maintained drum.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jade">JADE: a husband.... </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She begins walking her fingers up the length of Karkat’s sternum. Karkat knows damned well what a husband is. He’s been force-fed enough bad movies from Dave to pick up any human euphemism you could name. He still plays dumb sometimes, for comedic effect, to irritate his friends, or simply to avoid a topic of conversation altogether. If he’d known it would only fan the flames of discussion in this case, he would have kept his mouth shut.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jade">JADE: a husband is a little like what you both do already</p>
    <p class="jade">JADE: only with....... certain “benefits” :)</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: leave him alone</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jade does not “come on.” She glides her fingers up under Karkat’s chin so that they can rest on his lips, which are a little chapped. It doesn’t take much work to pop them open and slide both fingers in.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jade">JADE: if youre really that clueless.... i can show you.... </p>

    <p class="no-indent">Karkat looks like an animal with its leg caught in a trap. Eyes flickering, breath getting shallow. His bottom lip is trembling where Jade is stroking it with her thumb.</p>
    <p>It would be pretty easy to mistake his reaction for arousal, so it’s understandable that Jade is extremely surprised when Karkat snaps his jaw shut and chomps down on her hand.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jade">JADE: OW!!!!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She flies back, literally, spiraling up towards the ceiling so fast that her skirt puffs up and she gets all tangled in her clothes for a few seconds. She clutches her wounded hand and glares daggers at Karkat, ears flat under her long, dark hair.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: JADE, YOU WERE TRYING TO CHOKE ME TO DEATH WITH YOUR WEIRD, SOFT HUMAN FINGERS! WHAT WERE YOU TRYING TO DO? REACH INTO MY CHEST AND PULL OUT MY FUCKING PUMP BISCUIT FOR A MIDDAY SNACK?</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: IS THIS BECAUSE YOU’RE HALF BARKBEAST NOW?</p>

    <p class="jade">JADE: why do i even WASTE my TIME???</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: THAT’S A GOOD FUCKING QUESTION!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jade is pissed, but not enough to leave. Instead, she plops down on the opposite end of the couch and petulantly crosses her arms. Karkat peels himself off Dave and slumps into the dip between cushions while settling even more deeply into one of his better-practiced pouts. Dave clears his throat.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

There is almost no crime on Earth C, and so almost no one locks their door. In fact, most doors do not have locks, which has been terribly unfair to the struggling locksmith industry. Once, at John’s eighteenth birthday, Dave Strider engaged Jane in a shockingly aggressive debate about the economy in which he accused her of supporting “neoliberal corporate welfare” for pointing out this exact problem, which was... well, such a baffling incident that Jane is still thinking about it at absolutely random intervals five years later. She has an honorary business degree from almost every university on the planet. Dave hasn’t even finished middle school. What does he know about the effective and ethical rigors of corporate bailouts?</p>
    <p>Well, Jane thinks with a heavy sigh, now that she’s not running for president, it doesn’t really matter, does it?</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Jake?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jane feels rather like a princess in an animated film with the way her voice echoes up three flights of circular staircase. The mansion is dark and cramped—tall, narrow halls, gothic arches, rooms stuffed in all corners with kitschy junk. Jake has a taste for velvet paintings and faux-antique candelabras, which mesh less than harmoniously with the backdrop of his paisley wallpaper. Blue light filters in from the stained-glass windows on the top floor of the foyer where depictions of cerulean sirens lounge against surprisingly tasteful, modernist backdrops.</p>
    <p>Jane calls his name again, lifting her skirt so that she can climb the stairs one step at a time. From the second floor, she hears a sudden and awful noise: boots scrabbling against wood, glass shattering, hard objects hitting the wall, and the unmistakable roar of a rifle firing. She sprints the rest of the staircase and runs down the hall, <em>clack, clack, clack</em> in her expensive—but understated—kitten heels.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Jake! Jake, where are you?!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">The big oak door at the end of the hallway swings open, spilling orange lamplight into the darkness. Jake steps out, looking ruffled but handsome in corduroy shorts and a dress shirt buttoned up to midsternum. There is a smudge of gunpowder on his cheek. His whole face lights up when he sees Jane.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Oh jane how unexpected!</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Are you alright?! </p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: What? Of course! Why wouldnt i be?</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: I heard a horrible noise! What was all the racket?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Oh this?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake grins and holds up his rifle, which is still smoking from the muzzle.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Just a little morning target practice!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">He kicks the door all the way open behind him to show what’s up. A circular sitting room festooned with Christmas lights and paper targets, all of which look as if they have been hit many times with bullets. There is a battle bot hanging out by the fireplace at the back, holding an armful of bottles and surrounded by a sea of broken glass.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: You do this... in... inside the house?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">He looks at her like she’s the stupid one.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Well of course jane where else would i do it? Bringing this operation outside would only startle the neighbors!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jane’s mouth opens, and then hangs there for a moment as she decides whether or not this particular conversation on household propriety is worth having. Sometimes Jake simply cannot be blamed for the foolish things he does. After all, he literally grew up in the woods.</p>
    <p>Instead, she enters the room and takes a seat in one of the ostentatiously cushioned bergère chairs, careful to step around the puddles of cracked glass.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: I must ask jane... it seems that you are rather frazzled. Are you sure you arent the one whos not alright?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jane rests her temple in her palm. Jake grabs another of his ridiculous fake-Victorian chairs by the back and swivels it around so that he’s sitting across from her.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Have you talked to Dirk lately?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Er not exactly. I would say that i have been talked *to* by dirk.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: But the communique has certainly not been two sided.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Ah, yes. It seems that we’re in the same boat then.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: I haven’t heard from him. I stopped by his workshop, but it was locked. If he was in there, he wouldn’t come out. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dirk was the one person on Earth C who took the state of the locksmith industry with the seriousness it deserved. </p>
    <p>Jake scoffs and flops a hand. Both actions are dismissive.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: I dont see what all the ruckus is. Our good chum dirk fancies himself a dark and tortured soul. Cutting us off is not entirely out of his wheelhouse.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Yes, but not like this. It’s been years since he’s done a full blackout on us. Oh, I’m terribly worried.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: You worry far too much jane! Life has become so peaceable on this new planet of ours that i suppose dirk has merely tired of this idyllic life. It has either driven him permanently or temporarily insane.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Thats my theory at least. Maybe its tommyrot but i have faith that dirk will be back. After all where is he going to go?</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: ...You seem rather cavalier about this.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Like, even more cavalier than you usually are.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake laughs, all uneven, and runs a hand through his attractively tousled hair.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: I must admit i am rather half rats at the moment.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: You’re what?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Haha sorry that was a pretty obtuse way of putting it wasnt it.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: What i mean to say is that ive been powdering my hair quite a bit today.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">He makes a motion like knocking back a bottle. Jane side-eyes the idling battle bot, flush with empty wine bottles, and then side-eyes Jake. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: First thing in the morning?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Well i needed the bottles for my target practice jane i couldnt just pour the wine down the drain! Thatd be a waste!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jane frowns and leans forward on her knees so that she can examine Jake more closely. She sees it now. The unspecifically precise movement that comes from overcorrecting drunken body language, the unfocus of the eyes... That was a very detailed thesis he had on Dirk’s potential psychology, almost like he’d been giving it a good think. She knew that Jake and Dirk were not officially “together,” and had not been for some time, but their lives were still inexorably entwined on basically every level for some reason she did not understand. One might even say codependently. No matter what he said, this had to be affecting him as well.</p>
    <p>Jane lets out a fluttering breath.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: You know what, Jake?</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: You’re right. It really would be a waste!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She pushes out of the chair and goes to retrieve one of the unopened wine bottles sitting over the fireplace. They’re all screw-top, because Jake isn’t that classy. In fact, he isn’t classy at all. His veneer of classiness is about as authentic as an off-brand Halloween mask. Jane has no idea why she can’t get him out of her system, even after all these years.</p>
    <p>She braces herself on the mantle and knocks her head back, taking a long, uninterrupted swig right from the bottle.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Jeepers jane! Slow down!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jane keeps gulping. She drinks until she can’t stand it, then breaks off, shaking her head and letting out an ungraceful hiss. Golly, that is cheap merlot. Her vision is already swimming. Spilling a bit of wine on herself, she spins around to stare at the silent battle bot. It’s got its hand out, waiting for her to hand over the bottle.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Could you leave us alone, please?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">The battle bot tips its head at her with a click-whirr and then looks at Jake, who—traitorously—offers exactly zero backup. Dejectedly, the bot shuffles its way out of the room, but not before dropping every single one of the bottles it was holding so that they make as much noise as possible when hitting the floor. It slams the door behind it. Ah yes, Jane thinks. Scorched-earth policy. That robot was indeed programmed by Dirk Strider.</p>
    <p>Jake is staring at Jane wide-eyed behind his spectacles.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Jane i must ask again... are you quite alright?</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Actually no, I am quite not!</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: I will say. You really seem like youve got the morbs!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She staggers back to her seat and takes another swig of disgusting wine.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: I canceled my presidential bid.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: What? I was under the impression that you were awfully chuffed about that!</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: I was so incredibly chuffed about it, Jake. But Dirk called me just before his disappearance and told me to “cancel everything.” And so... </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jane puts her face in her hand miserably.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: ...I canceled everything. </p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Why jane do you really need dirk to run for president?</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Jane looks up at Jake from between her fingers and under her bangs.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Well yes, I suppose that I could run a successful presidential campaign on my own merits, especially since Dirk and I developed most of our strategy together.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: But now that I’ve pulled out I can’t just go back and tell them I’ve changed my mind. That would be so embarrassing! It would make me look wishy-washy. I can see the headlines now, calling me a “terminal flip-flopper.”</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Also... </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Somehow it just doesn’t seem right without Dirk.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake pries the wine bottle from her hand gently. He takes a drink from it, less gently.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Dirk has that manner about him does he not?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: A way about him that makes you feel like whatever you do as long as it does not involve him it doesnt count for dick.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">He sounds a little... bitter? Jane blinks at him.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: I hadn’t thought about it that way.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: But yes, ever since I talked to him I have felt... strange.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Her whole body is numb and floaty. Sure, she chugged the wine. But it’s strange to have gotten drunk so fast, isn’t it? Especially since she spends several nights a month drinking much harder and fancier drinks at investor dinners. Jake passes the bottle back and she takes another drink.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Strange how?</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Strange like you just explained... like nothing I do matters. I should be more upset that I’ve spoiled my chance at running for president, but for some reason I find myself not really caring.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: And that’s what I’m actually so upset about. The fact that I don’t care!</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Instead... </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">When did Jake scoot his chair closer? They’re sitting packed so tight now that his bare knees are brushing hers. The air between them is warm and wine-soaked. Jane takes another serious look at him, at his elegant jawline, his dark eyelashes, his handsome nose. It really is unfair that he’s so good-looking while also being so... so <em>Jake</em>. But this is nice, she thinks. When was the last time they talked? Really talked? It’s been such a long time that she’s almost surprised how good he’s being to her right now, considering that she walked in on him in Peak English Disaster Mode. Was it always this easy to talk to him?</p>
    <p>Maybe because of the wine, and maybe just because she wants to, Jane reaches out and sets a hand on his thigh. She leans in closer until she can feel his breath on her face.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Oh, this is mortifying to admit, but I’ve been thinking that perhaps I’ve been doing the wrong thing with my life.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Instead of all this business politicking I’ve been doing, what I’d really like... </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Is to settle down and raise a family.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Does that sound ridiculous?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Why that doesnt sound ridiculous at all! Its just that ive never heard you express such sentiments before.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Except of course for that time when you were under mind control and had me trussed up in your lair as you pontificated villainously about using me as a breeding stud to create a blood lineage for your incumbent corporate space empire.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Oh...  </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: You still remember that.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Jane youre one of my most cherished friends. I couldnt possibly forget a single moment weve spent together no matter how sexually uncomfortable the situation may have been.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jane feels herself turn red. Why did she think this would be so easy? Jake English was kind of a slut, true, but also their relationship was an emotional minefield. She slides her hand down to cup his knee, rolls her thumb into the dip of the joint there, and tries to remember the drunken advice on matters of seduction Jade gave her once when she was foolish enough to take a weekend off and go on one of her and Jake’s expeditions. She can’t for the life of her remember the substance of any of her lessons though.  </p>
    <p>Jake is still staring at her, drunk and enraptured. She ventures deeper into his personal space.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Well, Jake, it doesn’t always have to be that way.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Putting business first? Ignoring the good things in my life chasing profit? I’m sick of it.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: I think that I could be... loving. I could be a good wife.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: For the kind of man who needs a good wife in his life.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Like, say, an eligible bachelor with a hundred empty rooms in his house and no one to help clean them... </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Who has been recently and mysteriously abandoned by his long term... “companion.” Or whatever he was.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Someone handsome and lonely and who knows me well enough that we need not fear showing each other our less savory sides.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Such as... being drunk at nine in the morning.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Oh, Jake, isn’t that the dream?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake slants close, casting a shadow over her face. His eyes are so green, and they’re glittering with naked adoration, for her. It’s all for her. He nudges a knuckle under her chin and tips her face towards him.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Jane... </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">He’s so close that Jane thinks he might kiss her. She shuts her eyes and lets his husky wine-breath wash over her face.</p>
    <p>Instead of kissing her, he says:</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: I say this sincerely as one of your oldest and dearest friends.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: I hope that you have luck in finding a charming and bricky bloke who will summarily impregnate you with as much swiftness as possible and be a responsible father for your children.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: There is nothing for you i want more.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: ... </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jane’s mouth drops open. What was she expecting?</p>
    <p>But Jake doesn’t register her mortification or frustration either. He just keeps smiling and gazing into her eyes, warm and drunk.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Well, then. </p>
    </div>
    <p>With a deep sigh, Jane shoves Jake off of her and stumbles back to where his horrendous-tasting wine is stored. She pops open a bottle of briny-smelling moscato and tips it back—this embarrassing encounter isn’t going to forget itself.</p></div>

Which also means spending a lot of time with Calliope, which is awkward, but fine. But it also means spending a lot of time with Gamzee, which is awkward, and not even remotely fine.</p>
    <p>John, Roxy, and Calliope are taking a stroll through downtown New Prospit. Gamzee’s here too, a couple feet behind John, doing essentially the same thing that the other three are doing. Which is walking at a leisurely pace, but he’s being so weird about it that you can’t really call it strolling. It’s more like he’s... holding court, while somehow remaining in motion. Ever since he popped out of that fridge smelling like a sweaty foot, he’s been all “wise” and “sage-like.” John considers that if he were using these two descriptors out loud, he’d make air quotes while saying them. He’d then say Gamzee’s acting almost like a “priest,” which is a word he would also make air-quotes around, due to how insanely full of shit John still believes him to be.</p>
    <p>Roxy and Calliope, however, apparently do not believe him to be full of shit, for some reason. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: isn’t that nice?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: huh?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Gamzee is leading a line of adoring carapacians trailing behind him, telling them stupid, fake-zen stuff like “YoU GoTtA sToP tO sMeLl ThE sEeD fRoNdS mY dUdEs.” Not to be speciesist or anything, but the sight is kind of worrying because John knows all too well how susceptible carapacians are to grassroots populism. He has it on good authority that virtually any schmuck can blunder into a crowd of them, say a few inspirational words, and incite revolutionary fervor amongst the masses. John tries his best to ignore it and walk ahead, but Roxy loops her arm through his and pulls him back.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: were here check it</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: where’s here?</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: me n callies fave cafe!!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">It’s a nice place. Big, oval windows, flowers on all the tables. It’s got a French-ish aesthetic. John says “ish” because everything on Earth C is sort of “ish.” “Alternian-ish,” “Derse-ish,” “Japanese-ish.” He’d even describe the sky as being kind of “blue-ish.” Sometimes, it’s more turquoise than anything. Too crisp and bright, like the old Earth’s sky as seen through a pair of tinted novelty glasses.</p>
    <p>John doesn’t mean to be cynical about it, but he guesses that’s just the mood he’s in. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that Calliope insisted on including an unbelievably smelly clown on an otherwise perfectly pleasant stroll.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: that’s it? we’re going to a coffee shop?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i got out of bed for THIS?</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: lmao</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: oh john ur so FUNNY</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: no seriously roxy i just...  </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i mean, i feel like i haven’t left my house in years, and with all the stuff that’s been going on, like rose’s illness, or that stuff about the “political situation,” is it really a good idea for us to be having picnics and going out to coffee shops?</p>
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: oh john, don’t worry so mUch aboUt things that yoU have no control over.</p>
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: like i said the other day, it’s time for Us to leave Ugly things behind Us.</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: yea for real john cant u just enjoy what a beautiful day it is</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: i know IM enjoyin it</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: since i get to spend it with u like ive always been wanting</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: you... you have?</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: yeah duh</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She tugs him against her side and rests her head on his shoulder. She’s a bit taller than him in her nice shoes, so it’s kind of awkward. Feels uncomfortable to him, and looks more so for her. But he’s enjoying the attention. Sort of. He missed her, the way she used to be, when the two of them were close as kids. She’s laying it on a little thick for his benefit right now, and while he can appreciate that, it can be difficult to rekindle a friendship after it’s gone cold for a while. John wishes the rekindling period would hurry up and end already so they can just go back to shooting the shit like normal.</p>
    <p>Roxy drags him into the cafe. Calliope doesn’t follow them in, for reasons he can only guess at. He catches a glimpse of her through the window: a little forlorn, Gamzee at her side like a faithful dog. He can’t hear what they’re saying.</p>
    <p>Outside, Calliope clasps her hands and directs a wistful expression through the cafe window, foot traffic splitting lazily around her and Gamzee as they stand in the busy street. At high noon, her little body casts almost no shadow on the cobblestone road.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: sigh.</p>
    <p class="gamzee">GAMZEE: WhAt’S sHaKiN sIs, YoU lOoK bUmMeD aLl ThE fUcK oUt.</p>

    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: can’t yoU see what’s happening with roxy and john?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Gamzee stares through the window. Roxy is leaning across the table to dab at the corner of John’s mouth with a napkin. John looks very confused, because they aren’t actually eating anything yet. Gamzee stares at this for a very long time, his mouth lolling open as he contemplates what is transpiring with the closest facsimile to wisdom he can muster. He puts one of his huge hands on Calliope’s narrow shoulder, all comforting-like.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Gamzee leans in so that his face is level with Calliope’s. His grin shows every single one of his teeth. Miraculously, his breath smells worse than his body.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="gamzee">GAMZEE: MOTHERFUCKING DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT? &gt;:o)</p>

    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: we’re all going to be very, very happy. I trUly believe that. ^u^</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Calliope walks away, looking somewhat less than very, very happy. Gamzee remains standing in front of the cafe, still not entirely convinced that he shouldn’t motherfucking do something about it.</p>
    <p>John notices him there, just outside the window, leering at him and Roxy. His expression is serene, vacant. Calliope is nowhere to be seen.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: um, hey roxy...  </p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: wats up</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Roxy takes a sip of her tea. Her purple lipstick leaves a stain on the fine china.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Roxy sighs and spears the cherry atop her cheesecake with the absurdly tiny dessert fork it was served with. She pops it in her mouth with a pouty little lip pop, staring directly at John with her eyes half-lidded. He thinks she might be trying to be sexy, but he’s a bit distracted by the sight of Gamzee lumbering into the cafe with all the grace of an aubergine sasquatch sporting an epic erection. He puts both hands on the back of Roxy’s chair and looms over her. Without breaking eye contact with John, Roxy scoops up a spoonful of cheesecake and feeds it to him.</p>

    <p class="roxy">ROXY: i bet you gonna make a baller part of our greater ensemble if ur given the chance</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">John attempts to furtively gesture his disapproval with the entire situation toward Roxy by vaguely swiping his neck in a horizontal direction with his fingers, but she doesn’t notice. Instead she puts her fork down, slides her chair out, and springs to her feet with an abundance of this newfound enthusiasm he’s been struggling to understand.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="john">JOHN: um, alright. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">John and the date’s repulsive third wheel watch as she scurries to the back of the establishment. The moment the door to the bathroom closes, Gamzee lumbers into a sitting position across the table from John, without the slightest deviation in his heinously awkward comportment. He puts his forearms on the table in front of him, folds his hands, and gazes into John’s eyes with what he has come to identify as Gamzee’s signature brand of faux serenity.</p>

    <p class="rose">ROSE: Did you hear that Jane had been intending to run for president?</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Yes She In Fact Asked Me To Serve A Position In Her Cabinet</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: On The “Board Of Responsible Troll Reproduction”</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Oh dear. What did you tell her?</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Well Not In So Many Words </p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: But I Told Her To Kindly Fuck Off</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Rose arches an eyebrow at her wife, who is tending to the Mother Grub. Rose herself is sitting cross-legged on an outcropping over the lip of the breeding pit, knitting a series of tiny scarves for the grub clones that she and Kanaya have come to help hatch.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: That bad, huh?</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: She Was Already Talking About Regulating Troll Reproduction</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: With Great Confidence I Might Add As If She Had Already Been Elected</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Very presumptuous of her.</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Well I Suppose Her Confidence Was Not Unearned</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Who Was Going To Run Against Her</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Karkat?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Kanaya laughs to herself, more fond than mocking. Rose turns over another row on her scarf with dexterous ease, switching the knit pattern without missing a stitch. From behind her knitting she watches Kanaya check the shell thickness on a batch of eggs. Her wife is luminous in the early morning light, her rainbow-drinker skin soaking in the pink light and reflecting it back like the inside of a snail’s shell.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I don’t think Karkat would be such a bad candidate actually. Depending on certain factors I mean.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I’m assuming that in this theoretical scenario, Dave is handling the economy.</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Oh Of Course</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Ok. In that case it might have all worked out in the end.</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Doubtlessly</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: I Have Great Faith In Karkat And Always Have</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: However I Also Am Not Certain That He Could Step Out Of His Hive Without Catching On Fi–</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Swifer Could You Not Swiff The Mother Grub So Vigorously</p>
    <p class="kanaya">SWIFER: Oh, sorry ma’am!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Swifer Eggmop is Kanaya’s over-eager but well-meaning jade-blooded assistant. She talks a little like a parody of a 1920s newsboy archetype, which Rose can only theorize has to do with Jane’s influence on the culture. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="kanaya">SWIFER: Just tryin’ to get her nice and clean! I heard the New Prospit Hornographer’s coming by later to scope out some pics!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Swifer is at the center of the breeding pit, knee-deep in birthing juice as she mops down the Mother Grub’s exoskeleton. The parturition of troll grubs is apparently an arduous and grisly task, one that has stained the Mother Grub’s shimmering white exoskeleton rainbow-dark with various secretions.</p>
    <p>Rose takes a moment to feel grateful that her current relationship alignment leaves no chance for her to ever be “human pregnant.” Not that she has any particular distaste for motherhood. It might be nice to adopt a little troll grub once the whole ball on natural production gets rolling. </p>
    <p>Swifer adjusts the rate of her swiffing to a more acceptable level of vigor. She shines up the last of the segment she’s working on, then twirls the mop over her wrist with a martial flourish that absolutely recalls the fact that she is from a natural-born warrior species. She then gets to work washing the Mother Grub’s horns.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: What’s this about the Hornographer?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Since when has the press taken in interest in our activities down here?</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Oh Yes You Were Busy Dying When I Set All Of That Up</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: The Mother Grub Is Mature Enough This Year To Process Inseminated Slurry For The First Time In Our History</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: If The Government Gives Us The Go Ahead We Can Begin Breeding Trolls The Natural Way Next Month</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: I Arranged The Newspaper Story When... </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: When Jane asked you to sit on the “Board for Responsible Troll Reproduction”?</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Yes The First Thing I Did Immediately After Screaming Into A Pillow Was To Call My Acquaintance At The Paper</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Now That She Isnt Running It Doesnt Seem Very Important However</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Actually Im Not Terribly Interested In Politics At All</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Without Anger Motivating Me I Began To Think About How Its Probably Very Irresponsible For Any Of Us To Use Our Influence In Such A Way</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I agree. In fact, I’d just assumed that most of us had arrived at such a conclusion.</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Not Jane Apparently</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Or Dave, I’m sorry to say.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">There’s a third member of their social group who definitely hasn’t arrived at the conclusion that his power and influence should be meted out responsibly either. Neither of them speak his name, however. For some reason, it feels like a shadow passing over the sun. A brief spike of pain flickers through Rose’s head, a bolt that strikes between her eyes and splinters out. There is color and light behind it. A vision that tears through the material reality in front of her and gives her a brief glimpse into a parallel reality where things are very different.</p>
    <p>It’s gone as soon as she notices it. The image never materializes. She ties off the last row of her scarf and unwinds her knitting needles from the wool, a serene smile tugging at her lips. Since waking up in the hospital, she has stopped worrying altogether about what might be happening in splintered timelines. She has stopped worrying, in fact, about almost anything at all. A pleasant breeze rustles through her hair, carrying the sweet scent of early spring from the mouth of the chasm. Rose closes her eyes for a moment and breathes it in: taken just one minute at a time, a day can be filled with hundreds of perfect moments.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Well Whatever Inconvenient Party Ruining Opinions Dave and Jane Might Have About The Economic Future Of Our Planet Its All In The Past </p>

    <p class="rose">ROSE: Kanaya, you’re the “coolest chick” I know. </p>

    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Well</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: It Sure Isnt You</p>
    <p class="kanaya">SWIFER: Ma’am and Ma’am’s wife! Bank’s closed, ladies!</p>
    <p class="kanaya">SWIFER: The first egg is hatchin’ already!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Kanaya twirls on her heel, skin flickering bright as she lifts her skirt and jumps into the breeding pit. Rose sets down her needles and follows, walking along the edge of the pit to the place closest to the eggs. She crouches to watch the miracle of life begin.</p>
    <p>She’s never taken the time to come down here before and see the grubs hatch. Probably because she’s been too busy diminishing melodramatically on the couch to take an active interest in her wife’s life calling. The grub is already chewing through the chitin eggshell with all its little legs moving sinuously in offbeat concert.</p>
    <p>Swifer is sniffling. She makes the motion of wiping away a tear, somewhat cartoonishly.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="kanaya">SWIFER: Golly gee oh my. This part always makes me tear up.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Kanaya dips down to help the grub out of the shell. Her skirt trails through a puddle of birthing jelly, but she doesn’t seem to care. There’s an awed expression lighting up her face, in addition to the literal light emanating from her skin. She tears away the last chunk of the shell. It’s mottled and rough, like a rock on the outside, but has a layer beneath like mulched flesh. Kanaya’s hands are soaked blue with bloody yolk when she finally lifts the grub and holds it up to the light.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Rose Look</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Rose looks. All troll grubs appear kind of samey, but this one has a familiar look about her. Asymmetric horns, one crescent, the other harpoon-like. A mussed mane of hair and a mischievous glint in her beady little eyes. Particularly the one with seven pupils. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: ...  </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Vriska?</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Pretty Close</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: A Reasonable Genetic Approximation</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: This Brood Has Been Utilizing A Slurry Consisting Of Genes From Our Original Group Of Twelve Trolls</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Mostly This Results In Unique Individuals</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: But Sometimes Very Close Copies Occur</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: As With The case Of Ancestral Descendancy </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: So... Vriska would be this troll’s ancestor?</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Yes</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Wow. </p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Rose I Think This Is A Sign</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: A sign of what?</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Havent We Been Talking About Adopting A Grub</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Eventually, yes. But a natural-born grub. Don’t you think it will be somewhat... awkward, us raising a clone of your sort-of ex?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: What happens when Vriska comes back? What do we say to her?</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Rose Vriska Is Dead So It Doesnt Really Matter</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Is she dead, though?</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Absolutely</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: There Are Two Things Of Which I Have No Doubt</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: That You And I Are Going To Be Happy For The Rest Of Our Lives </p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: And That We Are Never Ever Going To See Vriska Again</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Baby-Vriska wiggles her six talons. Kanaya cradles the little grub against her chest and pokes it in the nose. The grub reacts by blowing a bubble of bright cerulean yolk membrane out from between its lips. To her own surprise, the sight melts Rose’s heart in an instant. The emotion that hits her feels like one of her old visions. Suddenly she can see her and Kanaya’s future so clearly, like a map rolled out at her feet and stretching far into the horizon. Kanaya is right. Vriska is dead, and despite everything, she died a hero. Vriska was a complicated figure of contrasting extremes; her heroic actions were matched in scale only by her monstrous ones, and since no one had actually witnessed her end, it was impossible to say which side the pendulum swung and judged her death—Heroic or Just.</p>
    <p>It would be a fitting memorial for her and Kanaya to raise a version of Vriska who would be given every chance to make good on her noble characteristics. A true, symbolic redemption arc. Something about the thought appeals to Rose’s taste for the dramatic flourish. It would be proof that this was all worth it in the end: the destruction of multiple universes, the death of Kanaya’s friends, the circuitous rites of suffering experienced by the nearly infinite splintered versions of every being to inhabit Paradox Space...  </p>
    <p>Rose loves her wife fiercely in this moment. The new Mother of her species, framed in a literal halo of light. She can’t contain her excitement. She leaps into the pit with Kanaya and runs to embrace her, not caring about the irreversible rainbow-colored stains that she’s smearing into her dress.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md" style="margin-bottom:0">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Oh Kanaya, you’re right. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: We are going to be so astonishingly happy!</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Karkat tries to tear Dave’s phone out of his hand, but Dave simply levitates several inches off the ground to hold it just out of jumping distance. Jade, pouting a bit, glides in between them and uses her Space powers to teleport Dave’s phone out from the center of his traumatized palm and into the pocket of her sweater.</p>

    <p>Jade claps, then makes a rectangle with her thumbs and forefingers, framing her hand-holding besties at the center of it. She’s taking a picture with her brain right now—Dave and Karkat, being all shy and intimate with the romantic backdrop of a brilliant twilight behind them. A pretty portrait. Put her in the middle of it, and it’s a work of art. Just what she wants the rest of her life to be. After all, where would these two pitiful beta boys be without her? </p>

    <p class="no-indent">Dave has gone catatonic. Karkat’s just as quiet, but it’s a quiet that’s as loud and alarmed as his actual voice. He’s got his head turned away from the situation he’s been forced into, as far as it will go. He’s concentrating so hard on looking elsewhere that he trips over a rock and is only saved by Jade picking the three of them off the ground as she takes flight. Karkat’s legs flail when his feet go out from under him.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: AUGH! DON’T DO THAT!</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: YOU KNOW I FUCKING HATE THAT!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jade sets them back on the ground, cackling like the witch she is. Karkat still won’t look at her. She stops laughing abruptly, sensing that her plan isn’t going as well as she’d hoped. She views the two boys as a broken electrical circuit, and herself as the conductor between the two charged points. She just needs to maneuver it into the correct configuration, like she did with their hands. She does a few quick calculations in her head, refusing to give up on her assumption that relationship issues can be solved the same way math problems can.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="jade">JADE: well take care of you... right dave?</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Dave doesn’t answer. She answers for him by leaning down and planting a dry, affectionate kiss on Karkat’s cheek. He yelps and leaps away like he’s been scalded by a burning iron, liberating himself from the deeply uncomfortable hug triad.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="no-indent">Dave ollies the fuck out of there, flash-stepping between one second to the next, disappearing thirty seconds into the future with the gusto of a piece of garbage flying into the fucking sun. Jade stares after him, blinking at the glare of the afterimage he left behind. It’s a glimmering slice of ultraviolet that only she can see. It lingers in the unstable particles between the air.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Karkat, when she turns to address him, is staring at her slack-jawed. He takes a step back, but isn’t watching where he puts his foot. His heel goes into a dip in the hill and he goes stumbling backwards, feet over head.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Jade could probably catch him. Actually, she could easily do it, but it doesn’t seem like the kind of favor you should do in a fledgling kismesissitude. So instead she watches him roll all the way to the foot of the hill, knees and elbows bouncing around all rag-dolled and furious as he swears up a storm. He hits the ground back first and just lays there for a few minutes, completely owned. He watches the darkening sky with a hollow look on his face for at least an entire minute. Then he slowly pulls himself to his feet and brushes the brambles off his pants. He points up the hill at Jade and shouts.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

The meat is cold and undercooked, so you have to grab it with both hands while you rend it apart with your incisors. It bursts in chunks, filling your mouth with blood and your throat with mangled knots of gristle and long strings of muscle fiber. You take big bites, almost too big to swallow, so big that you choke on the meaty mulch and hock some of it up into your nasal cavity. You sneeze out a gooey rope of phlegm and flesh. You stop for a moment to wipe your face, but your chin is still slippery after you swipe the mess away. Slivers of meat catch between your teeth as you masticate with bestial enthusiasm. You use your thumbnail to fish them out.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Finish up.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">Some of the blood has coagulated on the surface of the plate. You grab it from Calliope and lick it clean. She watches you—calm, placid, alien. Roxy has leaned forward to scrutinize your slovenly feasting, her eyes wide and intense. You stare back at them with your hands coated in unctuous organic matter and flecks of seared skin. The blood on your hands is so thin that it’s like oily Kool-Aid pooling in your palm.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Think, suddenly, about all the many horrible crimes committed by Lord English.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">God, that guy is the worst. The memory of his stupid face and his terrible art and all the abominable misfortune he has caused across multiple universes and time lines makes your meal start to curdle in your stomach. The meat sits there like a big, lardy mass—a black hole bursting the universe apart around it. You feel like rocks are churning in your gut and your mouth begins to water, hot and sour. The flavor of the afternoon air changes around you and it’s too hot, almost suffocating. You swallow back a mouthful of pungent bile as your eyes swim and lose focus.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; You know what you must do.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: i know what i must do.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Of course you know. What kind of guy would you be if you stayed here, when you’re the only one in existence capable of completing the grim task? A pretty shitty one, who just sneezed up a chunk of raw meat in front of a girl you used to have a gigantic crush on.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: i have to go back and kill lord english. </p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: everyone is counting on me.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Roxy pulls back and takes a deep breath. It’s a very thin breath, and her bottom lip quivers a bit when she sucks it in. She looks disappointed, though you could be misreading her, as usual. Calliope looks... well, her face is a permanently grinning skull. You’ll be damned if you know what’s on her mind either.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: i understand</p>

    <p class="no-indent">No one says anything for some time. A pleasant breeze rolls down from the hills. In the distance, the bell tower chimes twice. You notice that a group of carapacians have stopped to stare at you with beady-eyed fascination. The front of your shirt is stained with dark, slimy patches from the meat. Christ, why did you have to eat that meat like such a slob? </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: so, is that it?</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: ok then.</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: guess i’ll see you both... when i get back?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Neither of them reply. You look from one to the other, then back again. A loud belch escapes your mouth, catching you completely off guard. The gastrointestinal ambush releases an invisible cloud of chewed-up protein odor into the public park. The gross ball of muscle roils and snarls in your belly like an unruly groundhog, prodded yet reluctant to come out and see its shadow. Ugh, <em>why</em> are you thinking about this?!</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Hug them, dummy.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">You hesitate a few awkward moments too long. When you go to hug them, they’ve already turned away, leaving you standing in the middle of the park alone with your arms half-raised, cupping the air. It’s so pathetic that the eavesdropping carapacians finally scurry away, overwhelmed by their secondhand embarrassment. You didn’t even know they could get embarrassed. </p>
    <p>You drop your arms and sigh. Time to get on with it.</p>
    <p>Before you leave, you fly back home and take one last look around Salamander Village. You breathe in the clean, crisp air, listen to the pipes chime, soak up the unfiltered sunlight. You then head inside for a wipe down, since it feels like you’ve been making face-down snow angels on the floor of an ill-kept slaughterhouse. You head to your bathroom and wash all the meat off your face. But somehow you still don’t feel that clean. An invisible layer of oil seems to cling to almost every square inch of your body no matter how hard you scrub. </p>
    <p>You go to your bedroom desk and dig out some stationery.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Write: “dear roxy,”</p>
    <p class="no-indent">You’ve never written a note so quickly, or with such clarity of heart and mind. When you’re done, you write nine more. Your hands leave grease stains on the paper.</p>
    <p>You leave ten envelopes on your bed, arranged in a tidy circle with the names of your ten closest friends written on them. Then, with absolutely no fanfare, you leave all of them and this idyllic world you’ve created behind and zap yourself back into canon.</p></div>

The sun cuts through her venetian blinds, painting butter-yellow strips of light all the way from one end of her impeccably tailored office to the other. It’s a lovely day, like most days, so not terribly remarkable except for the horrid news that she has just received at her customary morning press conference. </p>
    <p>Jane comes to a brisk stop alongside one of her floor-to-ceiling windows—which span a full two-thirds of her office—and brushes her hands over her hips to smooth the wrinkles out of her powder-blue pencil skirt. Then she hems, haws, puffs out her cheeks, and takes a very deep breath before snatching a pillow off the nearest couch so that she can scream into it.</p>
    <p>There are, surely, a multitude of ways for a person to find out that an acquaintance is running against you in a presidential election. From a carapacian reporter, in front of twenty-six other members of the interspecies press, was not the method Jane would have personally chosen. She is certain that she retained her poise and managed not to look too shocked at the news. She did not exclaim “What?!” but instead managed to eke out through gritted teeth and pursed lips a reasonably thoughtful-sounding “Hmmmmmm!”</p>
    <p>She cannot believe that Karkat would do this to her. This is no longer a political fiat (which the election would surely have been had she run uncontested by any other civilization-founding celebrities) but rather a battle between “friends.” What did Vantas think he was doing?</p>
    <p>No, no—it’s not Vantas, Jane realizes. This could not have possibly been Karkat’s idea. Jane knows Karkat. Not intimately, or even casually, but well enough to have made a generalized assessment of his basic character over the years. He is not cut out for politics, neither intellectually nor in the very important matter of social constitution. Certainly not when it comes to economic policy. In fact, Jane is pretty sure that Karkat Vantas would probably literally burst into flame if too many people happened to look at him at the same time, like a vampire walking out into the sun.</p>
    <p>Wait. Jane lowers the pillow from her face and stares at her brass-and-glass art deco ceiling. Was that vampire thing xenophobic against Kanaya? Or whatever it was that Kanaya was supposed to be? No, of course not, she assures herself. With trolls it was the other way around: vampires were the only members of their species who didn’t balk at the sunlight. Another reason Karkat would make a poor president. Unless... he ran as the Night President? No, the idea is foolish. Best not to give him any ideas. There can only be ONE president.</p>
    <p>No, surely this must have been Dave’s idea. The kind of plot hatched from their little nest of mutually supportive, codependent, interspecies... whatever it was they had going on over there. Dave was certainly no Dirk Strider, no Rose Lalonde, no Roxy, but he had that same scheming gene, buried deep down beneath his transparent onion layers of posturing and, frankly, rather outdated humor. An instinct to plan. And despite being inarguably the dimmest of his family’s impressive ecto-biological stock...  </p>
    <p>Oh, dear. Stock. That’s likely a problematic word, isn’t it? Jane thinks. She crosses it off her mental list of “appropriate words to say during a press conference.” </p>
    <p>She returns to her train of thought. Despite being the least mentally gifted member of his family, Dave has always had an awful lot of opinions on the economy. In fact, Jane cannot remember a single conversation she’s ever had with him that wasn’t about the economy. She thinks back to one time at John’s eighteenth birthday when Dave engaged her in a rigorous and rather one-sided debate about deregulation and the failure of “neoliberal austerity measures” until Karkat had to come over and put his hands over his roommate’s mouth to make him stop talking. Come to think of it, of the few direct interactions with Karkat she’d ever had, this struck her as a truly great act of benevolence toward the common good. Maybe... he <em>would</em> make a good president?</p>
    <p>NO! She cannot succumb to such thoughts of weakness. She will not.</p>
    <p>Jane tosses the pillow back onto the couch and begins pacing the length of her office. This really was a disaster. She knew that she was solid on several demographic metrics; the human one, most certainly, and the well-to-do carapacian districts. But Karkat was incredibly popular in the Troll Kingdom, obviously, and carapacians were widely known to be swayed by underdog populism. And the consorts? Who had even given them the right to vote in the first place? In any other year... </p>
    <p>Jane hops up to sit on her desk and kicks off both her shoes. She picks up a pen and begins to chew the end to bits to stop herself from doing the same to her lower lip. In any other year, this wouldn’t be a problem. She’d be happy to accept a graceful, temporary defeat and let Karkat play president for a couple of years. After all, unlike her, he was not immortal. But Earth C’s paper-thin idyllic history was very close to a boiling point—its very first boiling point, in fact, which will have everything to do with the problematic nature of troll reproduction. The first generation of natural-born trolls obviously cannot be entrusted to a troll.</p>
    <p>Which was absolutely not a xenophobic thing to think. It was just realistic. The citizens of Earth C were able to rest easy knowing that the government held careful rein over the... well, over matters of equity. No one could possibly trust something so important to a troll, knowing what everyone knew about their violent history.</p>
    <p>Losing this election could mean social unrest, protests, even war.</p>
    <p>Jane presses her eyes shut and runs her fingers along the fine-grain patterns in her mahogany-paneled desk. She is about to think something that she has promised herself never to think again. In fact, she is about to say it—this horrible, ghoulish, girlish thought that used to rule her world and make her so terribly weak. The shameful thought is expressed out loud in the form of a defeated sigh.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: I need Jake.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She spins around and, still sitting on her desk, presses a familiar entry on her phone’s contact list.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Ahoy ahoy!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jane has to suck in a hard breath to stop herself from groaning. Why were so many of the finest young minds on this planet slaves to this foolish man’s perky glutes?</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Jake! Hello, how are you doing?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: As well as can be i suppose considering that i just woke up in the middle of a mafficking ruckus at the stadium after getting beaned in the pumper with the ol’ horse tranquilizer trick.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Which i suppose i should have seen coming, as dirk has ended all of our matches in this fashion for the past week. </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Oh dear. That sounds absolutely terrible, Jake. Is there anything I can do to help?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Help? Gadzooks woman! I hardly think myself in need of help.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Its a jolly good adventure working with someone so predictably unpredictable as our good friend dirk!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">You would think that Jake enjoyed the sadomasochistic nature of his and Dirk’s personal and professional relationships. Judging from the last conversation about election strategy with Dirk, he seems to be perfectly aware of this feature of Jake’s personality. You can’t be too nice when courting his endorsement, Dirk would say. He doesn’t respond to nice.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Be that as it may, Jake, I still do worry about you an awful lot.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Well that is...  </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">On Jake’s end of the line there is a crash, followed by a noise that sounds suspiciously like something big and hollow and metal connecting with Jake’s head. When Jake comes back to the phone, he’s yelling into it. Jane grimaces.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: ...very sweet of you jane! I appreciate very much that you have called me out of the blue to say such nice things to me with no ulterior motive!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">From anyone else, this would have been a portentous statement. However, Jane knows that Jake English could not have possibly meant this with anything but the utmost sincerity. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Well, you know that I—</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Because i must note that although i try to stay sporting about what comes at me, i cant say that i am chuffed about how much of my correspondence lately has to do with the marketing of my image.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Its beginning to feel like all people want from me is to stick my derriere on a signpost for their own profit.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Oh, Jake. </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: You’re right. It must be so difficult. For you more than the rest of us, due to your, let’s say...  </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Natural gifts?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Huh?</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: But you know that I have always wanted what’s best for you, right?</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: And I am ready to give that to you.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: To give me what?</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: The best, Jake. The very best.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake is quiet a moment, and Jane can hear the rusty gears turning in his head.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: You should stop by to see me this evening!</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Do you mean my evening or yours? Were in different time zones right now and i dare say that the sun just went down here so if you wanted to have a soiree on my time youve missed your chance.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jane feels her fake smile flexing so hard that it was beginning to hurt. Oh yes, she loved this man in basically every category that you could possibly love a person, but sometimes talking to him is like trying to build a house of cards while riding a mechanical bull. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Mine, of course! I’ll have the best year of your favorite crocodile-made scotch flown in from the Consort Kingdom and we’ll have a little catch-up. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake actually hates scotch, and only drinks it for appearance’s sake. But for this—for this unbelievably pivotal moment in the history of the planet that they created with their bare hands—Jane is willing to spend a few thousand boonbucks to watch her old friend pretend to sip at the same glass for a couple of hours while prattling on. </p>
    <p>And she’s willing to do more than that, too.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: When’s the last time we’ve done that, just you and I?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: You know what? Youre quite right. Its been a spell since weve met up without dirk.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: An unforgivably long one at that! Whip me up a kipper jane ill be over promptly!</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: A... kipper?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She considers asking if he intended to request that she literally prepare a fish for his arrival. But of course, Jake has already hung up.</p>
    <p>With a heavy and somewhat regretful sigh, Jane sets her phone down on the desk. Well, she thinks, that’s that. Time to work your magic, Crocker. </p></div>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">You stop trying to loudly reassure the worried teens for a moment, and just think. Now you understand defeating young Lord English was never supposed to happen. Not the way Adult Rose was implying it would. You surmise the other four teens remaining outside the juju were the ones meant to be tasked with his defeat. And judging from the cacophony still emanating from beyond the walls of this house and its confining chest, they are taking the task seriously.</p>
    <p>But what does this mean for the four of you?</p>
    <p>You try to picture what’s going on in the battle outside, but it’s not easy.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Use your imagination.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">In your imagination, the battle is quite vivid and exciting. The coolness of the action in your mind’s eye is belied by the actual sound effects booming all around you, which you can only describe as vaguely stupid. There’s a lot of hysterical screaming, which, if you’re not mistaken, is coming exclusively from the male combatants. There’s a sudden swelling of energy that speaks to a vastness behind its power source. Almost as if an outrageous bubble of pure Hope were enveloping the stage, is how you would describe it if you didn’t mind sounding ridiculous. Then you hear... it can’t be. Horses?? No, not simple horses of flesh and bone. These horses are metal, if we’re to believe they’re horses at all.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Stop using your imagination.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">This isn’t getting you anywhere, and clearly your silly imaginative whims aren’t doing the slightest bit of justice to the actual awesome things taking place out there in the heat of battle. Frankly, your theorized skirmish lost the handle on any legitimacy it might have had the moment you started thinking about horses. You figure no one will ever truly know what’s happening out there. You doubt anyone would even be able to handle how incredible the raw, unfiltered account of this teen brawl actually was, so it’s probably for the best.</p>
    <p>As you slip out of your fanciful conjecture, which may or may not have included a mechanical horse ambush, you overhear Dave from one of the rooms below you, raising his voice to speak to either you or someone else. You’re not sure. You place your ear to the floor again.</p>
    <p>He’s speaking to Jade. They’re attempting to reminisce again, to the best of their ability to do so while shouting through a wall. Once more you ruefully reflect on these teen versions of your friends, and all the questions they must have for you. For each other. What would you even say to them?</p>
    <p>Would you want to tell them about the happy outcomes, knowing they might never get the chance to experience those things for themselves? Would you tell them the sad outcomes, thus reinforcing their insecurities and suspicions that they may never truly be capable of living happy lives? You’re not even sure you could handle it, if you were Teen John. You’d have too many follow-up questions, which Adult John is in no way prepared to answer. Would you tell them what’s up with Roxy and Calliope, again having no real grasp yourself over what’s up with them? Would you tell them Dave and Karkat... uh... live in a hive together watching TV all day, and Jade maybe kinda sorta lives there too, but nobody quite knows what’s really going on with that? Would you tell them about Terezi...  </p>
    <p>For some reason her name feels like nails in your heart. Makes sense, you guess, cause there’s a lot of sharp letters in it. She had sharp teeth too, and sharp elbows. Sharp words. Terezi Pyrope was a sharp girl, and maybe what these sharp feelings are trying to tell you is you miss her more than you realized.</p>
    <p>She wouldn’t have let you neglect relationships with certain friends for so long that you missed whole chapters of their lives. She wouldn’t have put up with you moping around with the salamanders for so long. She would have kicked your ass for being such a loser about everything. She would have poked you in the forehead and called you insufferably lame and told you to pick up the damn phone. You would have called her a weirdo and pretended you hated it, and maybe you would even have believed you hated it. But now, sitting here in this little white cubicle, contemplating your regrets, you don’t think you’d have hated it much at all.</p>
    <p>Would you tell the teens that?</p>
    <p>You’d probably never tell anyone that. Not even her.</p>
    <p>Another arbitrary thought hits your brain, completely unrelated to the subject of Terezi, or what you would or wouldn’t tell a bunch of incarcerated teens, or so you think.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: am i... depressed??</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">You ask aloud, quietly enough that your friends cannot possibly hear it. All the question does is crawl back down your throat and burrow into your gut like it lives there. And it does live there, because as it turns out, you are really fucking depressed. You’re just a giant, wet meat sack of self-involved misery, and all that big, wet, meaty ooze drips out your mouth every time you open it. All the time and space in the world isn’t making it better. It’s something you should have been doing for yourself, instead of waiting around for things to get better.</p>
    <p>Well, screw waiting! It’s boring as hell! You are JOHN EGBERT, after all, immortal CREATOR OF WORLDS, the one and only man ever to completely transcend the partitions of CANON ITSELF. You’ve got these powers, remember?   </p>
    <p>You hold up your hands and form a rectangle with your fingers and reach outside yourself, outside canon, to the place your retcon powers come from. You focus. You strain. You contemplate with all your might a place you can zap to, any place but here. </p>
    <p>You wait. And wait. And wait and...  </p>
    <p>Nothing happens.</p>
    <p>You slump back down against the wall, and your despondence eagerly greets you again. Like an old friend ready to pat you on the back and say, good try man. I’ll always be here for you, when you fail. Thanks dude, you think. </p>

    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: JADE, ARE YOU HEARING THIS?</p>
    <p class="jade">JADE: im scandalized</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">It’s been a really nice day they’ve been having, and then Jade had to go say something like that. The air in the hive changes in a way that is palpable, in a way that she can’t seem to accurately gauge despite having both superhuman and superdog senses. She’s lying on her stomach on the floor, chin in her palms, glasses slid down to the tip of her nose, kicking her legs in the air. Elements of her outfit resemble her god tier jammies: peasant skirt, sparkly flats, and a bold choice in striped tights. Her tail swishes from side to side, showing way too much of her thigh, which isn’t really all that salacious considering three of her bras are thrown over the back of the couch where she crashed last night, and the night before that, and the better part of the seven years before that. There are other personal effects of hers in the living room too: plants on the windowstill, her bass guitar sitting in a corner, a horrific-looking periodic table that Dave made her for her seventeenth birthday pinned above the stairwell. He typed it in Comic Sans, and then deep-fried it to oblivion with JPEG artifacts. </p>
    <p>Everyone in this room knows each other way too well, so what happens next goes a little like clockwork.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: UHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Says Karkat, for like thirty seconds straight as he retreats into the bulk of his sweater. He scoots a half foot to put his back against the couch when Jade pushes her glasses up the bridge of her nose and looks at him.</p>
    <p>And Dave, with his preternaturally perfect timing, sweeps a hand over his tablet to bring up a new PowerPoint slide on the TV. He returns to his Comic Sans-written political presentation, gruesome artifacts and all, with the grace and proficiency of a man who has diffused an awkward situation in his own household many times per day, every day, for many years.</p>

    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: YES, OF COURSE I FUCKING HAVE.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Karkat elbows Dave in the thigh, a move that is obviously meant to be an action of pure, brotherly jest. But instead it comes off as affectionate and overly intimate. Jade’s clever eyes don’t miss this. Her pupils follow the motion of Karkat’s arm, and then they follow the movement of Dave’s mouth as he smiles in what he probably thinks is a totally neutral expression that reveals exactly 0% of his true feelings toward Karkat Vantas. In reality, his veneer is as thin and transparent as cellophane. He is the only person who can’t see through it.</p>
    <p>Jade does some calculations in her head. Two kinds of calculations, in fact: mathematical ones and personal ones. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jade">JADE: soooooo</p>

    <p class="no-indent">She proceeds to dazzle the two boys with explications on complex math utilizing taxation rates, GDP figures, and some damned thing called the “Laffer curve,” which she easily could have just invented to own them both. But the truth is, she cares too deeply for these boys to fabricate silly-sounding economic models on the spot in order to make them seem foolish in front of the camera later. </p>
    <p>The thing about Jade Harley is that she’s not as good at personal things as she is at other things. Like science, or mastering fraymotifs, or kissing, the last of which she has definitely put a lot of levels into over the past few years because, well, what else are you supposed to do with immortal godhood once you hit the age where the dog hormones start kicking into overdrive? She rolls over and hitches up on her palms so that she can stare her two friends down. Her high-prescription lenses make her eyes look anime-huge. They might literally be glittering, she’s so completely serious about the issue she is trying to stress.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jade’s grip on Karkat’s hand gets a little too tight, but her big-toothed smile remains flawlessly pleasant. This is a common sort of exchange between them and could be easily considered flirtation on several different metrics, especially considering the history between them and the sheer level of black flirtation that Karkat accidentally indulged in during his insecure youth. He doesn’t even pull his hand away.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Karkat has finally pulled his hand away so that he can clutch his stomach, he’s laughing so hard. Jade gets up and stalks over to where Dave is awkwardly cowering at the other end of the couch and snatches his tablet from him. There’s a ripple in the room that makes it clear their god tier powers have just clashed against each other. He shifts his arm through time and Jade warps the space around them so that she’s the one holding the tablet. This is not the first time that they have rearranged the fabric of reality for a petty reason like this. Karkat has permanently sworn off playing board games with them.</p>
    <p>The moment Jade brings the paint program up on the television, Karkat stops laughing.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: NO!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">He tries to grab the tablet from her, but she’s hovering well above the ground and he simply is not tall enough to reach. With a shit-eating grin and deliberate care, Jade begins to draw a grid.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Her artistic skill even at the advanced age of twenty-three still leaves something to be desired, but it’s pretty easy to produce recognizable caricatures of the three people in the room right now. She gives Karkat a pair of fuzzy, angry eyebrows and starts drawing other lines. Sinister lines, with salacious meaning. It’s exactly what Karkat fears: a shipping grid.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="no-indent">Karkat catches the back of her shirt and she goes plummeting weightlessly to the floor, still laughing. Karkat tries to wrestle the pen out of her hand, but all he accomplishes is turning the redrom trajectory between her and Dave into a redrom loop-de-loop. </p>

    <p class="no-indent">Jade finishes drawing a shaky heart directly into the paint program. It’s so big and bright on the TV that it fills the entire room with red light. Karkat raises his face and stares at it in utterly bereft horror. The sick light makes the bags under his eyes look like divots. </p>

    <p class="no-indent">No one reacts. Karkat is defeated, completely. Dave has just crossed his arms and pressed his mouth into a thinner line than usual. Jade’s ears flatten and she huffs. It sounds a little like a dog whining.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Jade rolls her eyes and tosses both the tablet and pen over her shoulder. Dave flashes across the living room to catch his very expensive computing device in both arms. The pen bounces off his forehead. Jade dismounts from Karkat’s poor, abused, terribly mortal spine and brushes down her skirt.</p>

    <p>What Jade leaves in her wake is not quite the emotional scorched-earth situation that she was going for, but a few of her needles have definitely gotten under some skin. Dave and Karkat both stare after her, silently caught in their own private rationalization spirals.</p>
    <p>Karkat needs to verbalize part of his out loud.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">It seems as if you’re attempting to be John again, with the expectation that we might spend a little more quality time with him in his cubicle of misery and self-loathing. You guessed we might really start to unpack his depression issues. Get to the bottom of all that. Well, nice try. John can’t be here right now, because he’s stuck somewhere in the harrowing nexus between canon, post-canon, non-canon, outside canon, and fanon. He also can’t be here right now because, for the time being, we’re done wasting our breath on such a sad loser. It’s well overdue for the true hero of this tale to take center stage.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Be Vriska.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">Lord English stands before you in all his time-eating, universe-ending glory. You rode in here like a total badass, and now you’re presiding over a whole host of ghosts ready to throw themselves once more into the maw of this final battle. You know that this isn’t your battle to win, but you are definitely the sign of the tide turning. Hell, you ARE the tide. This whole thing would have been pretty dismal if you hadn’t shown up with the treasure chest containing the ultimate weapon, not to mention your flawless defeat of an obstructionist, hectoring, orange man, who for reasons you cannot begin to comprehend seemed to be obsessed with you.</p>
    <p>You have already executed what is probably the most important tactical maneuver ever performed by a hero in the history of heroism: you deployed the white, house-shaped juju from the red chest. It grew to an enormous size, slammed down on whatever was passing for the floor in this esoteric battle environment, and a door materialized on its surface. You now stand off to the side looking especially pleased with yourself, waiting for the legendary weapon to unload itself toward the hulking tyrant. </p>
    <p>You’ve now got two bitches of either gender at your side: your main girl Meenah, who you stole from that embarrassing past version of yourself that you owned so hard you bet she’s probably <em>still</em> crying. And Tavros. Not just any random ghost copy of Tavros, of which there appear to be thousands. <em>Your </em>Tavros, specifically, who’s been pathetically trailing after you like a lost barkbeast since you showed up.</p>
    <p>You’d be hard-pressed to describe what’s happening right now. If they sent a poet, maybe he’d do better job of it. But they sent someone who’s actually <em>useful </em>instead, so you’ll give it a shot. It looks to you like the complete obliteration of space and time, the end of all things, the disintegration of literally thousands of ghosts. And no doubt your admirers out there would love it if you described it all in painstaking detail, but you’re not an executionist. You just call it like you see it, and what you’re seeing right now is pretty awesome.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Observe Lord English.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">Kind of an overworked character design, you think to yourself. If someone showed you a drawing like this on their FLARP sheet you’d probably be obligated to immediately kick their ass. There’s a lot going on, from his vein-popping muscles to his eight-ball eyes to his pirate leg and his ostentatiously bright, gold pimp cane. Years ago, you brutally criticized Terezi for adding a dragon-head staff to her Redglare cosplay. The argument that ensued was so bad she didn’t talk to you for an entire week. Now that you’re seeing this, well... you wouldn’t apologize to her, <em>o8viously</em>, but in retrospect maybe her accessorizing wasn’t so bad. At least she understood the basics of having a simplified silhouette.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Meenah gives you a grin and a salute and leaves you to it. This is what you always felt you were destined for, somehow. Standing at the end of the universe and seeing how it all goes down. Tavros is clinging to your arm like a little crybaby, while crying, you assume, and probably soiling his dumb little pair of shorts. But not you. You’re fearless. Your eyes are so wide that it feels like you’re eating all the light through them. That’s what you are, after all. <em>The Thief of Light</em>. You crane back your neck and: </p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Watch Lord English put a crack in reality.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">It’s beautiful. You thought maybe he’d do something stupid, like punch the sky with his gross, throbbing muscle arm? But all it takes for him to shatter the roof of existence is a single, ear-splitting roar. Around him, the ghost army scatters. Tavros flinches and hides his face in your shoulder, and probably pisses himself again for good measure. But you...  </p>
    <p>Get smashed in the head?</p>
    <p>It was so fast and dark you didn’t see it—the shard of space-time that split off from above and hurtled toward you. Your body rocks back, whiplash fast, and you nearly keel over. You’re still standing though, and laughing. That’s what you were doing when Lord English put a split in the fabric of reality. You were <em>laughing</em>, not crying. It doesn’t hurt at all.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="tavros">TAVROS: vRISKA,,, aRE YOU OKAY?</p>
    <p class="vriska">VRISKA: Shhut up!!!!!!!! I’m... I’m </p>

    <p class="no-indent">You stagger back and put a hand to the head wound. Your eyes spin. All eight of them. It’s not a big deal though. Just a scratch. It’s fine fine F8NE.</p>
    <p>Your hand comes away coated in thick blue. Your hair is soaked with it all the way down on one side. Why is broken space-time so <em>sharp</em>? Like splintered obsidian. Feels like it barely grazed you, and yet...   </p>
    <p>Everything around you begins to spin, and you’re not sure if... you can’t <em>quite</em>...  </p>
    <p>A stream of blood begins to leak in under your glasses. Noise whirls around you: Lord English losing his shit, ghosts shouting, moving, the broken-glass sound of the ceiling of space splitting into hundreds of shards of potentiality. There’s a hum beneath all of it, a deep, dark reverb, a black hole sucking everything into the dark maw of infinity. You wipe your bloody hand on the leg of your jeans and sneer with rage. You won’t go down so easily. </p>
    <p>Tavros tries to steady you, but you slap his hand away.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="vriska">VRISKA: N8W T8VROS!!!!!!!!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Tavros scurries off into the fray to find someone less worthless. You try to catch your bearings so that you won’t miss a single instant of the battle, but you’re distracted by something in the corner of your glasses. Your Trollian alert is blinking. There’s a message from Terezi. How long has that been there? Hours, days? You suddenly wonder if it’s been years from her perspective, waiting for you to respond, given how time moves differently out here. Were you too preoccupied with your incredible heroic exploits to notice?</p>
    <p>Focus, Serket. This is no time for sentimental thoughts. You need to get a grip. Keep your head in the game, keep both feet planted firmly... whoops.</p>
    <p>Your feet slip. Without Tavros to keep you steady, you lose balance and begin drifting. You try to regain your footing, but you realize you aren’t in danger of falling over. That’s not the problem. You can’t seem... to get your feet back on the floor? You feel light. You’re... floating. You flail your legs, scraping the tips of your shoes against the floor, but it’s no use. </p>
    <p>You understand what’s happening. It’s the black hole.</p>
    <p><em>It’s starting to lift you up.</em></p>
    <p>You glance wild-eyed toward the glowing juju. Its four chambers and peaked roof are pulsing with the energy of raw imminence. This is it! Everything you’ve been waiting for, whatever it is, is about to happen. <em>Where’s Meenah?</em> You desperately try to stabilize yourself, slow your ascent, anchor yourself back to the floor in some way. Any way. But there’s nothing to grab on to. There’s blood in your eyes and your depth perception is fucked. Your hand goes wide and your fingers close around empty space as you reach impotently toward the glowing symbol of everything you ever believed you were meant for.</p>
    <p>This can’t be how it goes. As you continue to levitate, gaining speed in the direction of the insatiable cosmic body, you can see your blood trailing behind you in wet, cerulean blobs. The juju glows brighter. You need to see what happens next. You NEED to SEEEEEEEE! You’re so frantic, grasping for purchase in the empty air, that you aren’t ready for it. Another black shard of space-time hurtling through the void. It collides with your chest, right at the place where your ribcage connects, and sends you spiraling ever faster toward the deep, dark maw of infinity. A black hole is something not even a god tier player can survive, you suspect. And even if one could, you highly doubt there’d be any clawing your way out of its event horizon and back into relevance. Not this time. It’s a fate worse than anything you can imagine, and as it truly sinks in—what is happening to you, how this is <em>ending</em> for you—finally you lose all sense of composure. You flail, spin, and flip in helpless little circles like a bloody rag doll, and you begin to scream. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md weight-bold">—</div>
    <p class="Command">&gt; JOHN: Emerge from the juju.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">The first thing you hear is a tiny scream getting sucked into oblivion. The voice is familiar, but not as familiar as the second thing you hear, which is a <em>crack</em>.</p>
    <p>It’s not just a crack in your ears. This crack goes all the way down your spine. You almost don’t react to it because it’s so familiar. Around you, a cacophony rises up like steam.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: oh shit</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: its really popping off out here</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dave’s voice reminds you that your teammates have emerged from the house along with you. You survey the group. Everyone is account for. Three confused, frightened teenagers.</p>
    <p>You can’t see anything but big, bright smears all along the horizon. You fish the two halves of your broken glasses out of your pocket and hold them up to your face. The scene comes into focus: the eye of a storm, a black hole so massive it stretches as far as you can see. An army of ghosts swirling and screaming, whipping around you like leaves in the wind, and at the center of it all is Lord English, just like in your dream. </p>
    <p>You can feel it now. The moment reality yawns too wide and snaps in half. </p></div>

For some reason Jane has the shades pulled shut all the way around, so he’s been hovering here for way too long in his best tie and his best pair of short-shorts. There’s a crowd gathered below, gaping at a rare in-person appearance of a globally famous butt. The sunset has turned the head offices of Crockercorp into a shimmering glass monolith—a beacon, if you will, of the future, visible for miles in every direction.</p>
    <p>Jane probably likes to think about it that way at least.</p>
    <p>Speaking of Jane, she pops her head out from between two strips of silk-lined venetian blind to glower at Jake, who is hovering uselessly in the air. <em>Use the front door</em>, she mouths at him. But he responds with his specialty: incomprehension.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Im sorry... what?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">The exasperated hand motions Jane tries next work better.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Oh! The front door, of course!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake flies down to the street so that he can take the front entrance. He whistles a quaint little ditty to himself while he waits for the elevator to go up to the top floor. This time he knocks on the office door, and Jane lets him in.</p>
    <p>Inside the office it’s dark and hazy. The whole place is candlelit, and Jane is reclining on her desk, sprawled out like a lounge singer on a grand piano. Specifically: a blue lounge singer, on a blue piano, just like in one of the hideous velvet paintings Jake bought in New Prospit a few years ago. Like all of his impulsive purchases, the tacky thing is gathering dust in a pile somewhere in one of the hundreds of spare rooms in his mansion, which now primarily functions as a very expensive warehouse for his atrocious hoarding habits.</p>
    <p>And intimate knowledge of his hoarding habits—particularly the type of sultry, cerulean content he is known to hoard—is <em>exactly </em>why Jane is wearing a blue dress with a very high hem. Jake’s bow tie practically spins at the sight of it. He freezes on the spot, an animal in the predatorial headlights of this buxom blue businesswoman.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Come have a glass of scotch with me Jake. We have so much to discuss.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: I-indeed.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">He crosses the office and shakily accepts the offered glass of ludicrously expensive fermented barley grain. He raises it to his nose and pretends to sample the scent.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Jane i must say that is a very striking ensemble.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Oh, you like it? Why don’t you...  </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Er, come take a closer look?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She’s really bad at this, she thinks. “This” being seduction. She’s so bad at it, in fact, that Jake immediately recognizes her ruse for what it is. Laughing nervously, he sucks the whole glass of scotch into his mouth in one go, ice cubes and all. And then, because he can’t actually stand the taste of scotch, immediately spits it back out, ice cubes and all, spraying Jane’s brand-new sexy dress with quite an ungentlemanly fountain of boozy spittle. Jane is lashed both by the scotch in her face and how quickly her plan has fallen apart.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Jake!</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Bejabbers!</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Oh no, all over my new dress... </p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She tries to push him away, but Jake considers himself to be a gentleman. He helps her to the floor and shrugs off his dress coat so he can use it to wipe her down. She is staring at the ceiling like she hopes it will split open and suck her into a supermassive black hole so she doesn’t have to deal with anything that is going on right now. Some of Jake’s scotchy slobber is on her glasses, which is not the place she was planning on having it tonight.</p>

    <p class="jake">JAKE: I should hope so!</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jane puts a finger to Jake’s lip and shushes him. It’s a very smooth move. A total recovery. He shushes, and she directs him to one of the couches that line her office. They stumble there, his jacket and hands still wrapped around her shoulders. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: I’m sure you’ve had an earful about the election already.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: I apologize. You must understand that my mind is quite occupied by it right now.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: But I’ve been doing an awful lot of thinking as of late. </p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: I see. About what?</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: About everything, I suppose.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: About my life, about all of our lives and the trajectory they’ve taken since we helped to create this new universe. </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: You must admit that it’s a lot to grasp, and I’m not certain we’ve all taken the time to truly contemplate our place in it.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">This is not really the kind of conversation you initiate if you’re looking to extract a sexual deal out of someone. It is, however, the kind of conversation that you might have with a childhood friend who has become somewhat emotionally estranged from you. Both so busy with their exciting careers and misuse of their godhood. Who are they now? The same Jake and Jane who passed like particularly dysfunctional ships in the night a decade ago? Or is Jane wiser, and Jake kinder? Are they better versions of themselves? Jane absently rubs the narrow strap of her dress between two fingers, vainly attempting to sort out her jumbled thoughts.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: That’s an earful jane.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: I know. It’s a head-full too.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: I can’t help but worry...</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Haven’t we really just been... drifting these last seven years?</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Drifting, both in the sense of failing to fulfill our personal potentials,</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: And in the sense of... well, drifting apart?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jane pulls a leg up beneath her, which slides her bare knee between Jake’s. The couch dips a bit under their weight.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: I must admit i never thought of it that way.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: I know.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: It’s just that... we’re both so busy all the time. The years go by so fast. And... </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: I miss you.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake blinks, his eyes wet and glossy beneath his spectacles.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Ah. Well... I suppose that i miss you too jane.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">The moment goes from calculated to genuine in an instant. Jake drops his coat and glides his hands down her bare arms so that he can... hold her? Yeah, that’s definitely what he’s doing. Holding her, and not too gently either.</p>
    <p>Jane really is quite pretty, with the candlelight glittering across her spectacles, her hair damp, and her front teeth poking out from beneath her lip. She’s so pretty that Jake can’t stop himself from sliding a hand up to her neck and using his thumb to tip her face back so that they’re staring right at each other in the low light, close enough that Jane can probably smell his disgusting scotch breath. She definitely does smell it, because her cute nose scrunches up and she laughs again, a very small, private noise. A noise just for him. </p>
    <p>So he kisses her. Very well, if he does think so himself. Dirk has given him a lot of uninvited but incisive criticism on his kissing over the years, so Jake wouldn’t be surprised if he was considered the best kisser on the entire planet at this point. Jane breathes in, shocked for a moment. Even more shocked when Jake hooks a hand around her waist and pushes her down. She makes a startled noise into his mouth. Then she throws her arms around his neck. It should be awkward, taboo at this point, considering the history between them. But it all happens so easily. Jane undoing Jake’s bow tie, Jake hooking his thumb under the hem of her dress and hiking it up another inch it really cannot spare for decency’s sake.</p>
    <p>There is nothing awkward about this moment, Jake thinks. Two old friends, hot as the blazes, giving in to passion? Who could accuse them of impropriety? Nobody worth their salt, in his book. It all makes perfect sense. The inevitable consummation of a whirlwind romance fit for the big screen.</p>
    <p>Really, the only surprise is how long it took to happen. Jane is a beautiful lady, that’s for sure. She always has been, but she’s only grown more ravishing as she’s come into the full blossom of her womanhood. Smooth, silky skin... thick, dark lashes... full, feminine lips... not to mention curves like the dickens. It’s all certainly conducive to activities of close phonological proximity to the phrase.</p>
    <p>Jane’s baby-soft palm, unmarred by the calluses of deft swordsmanship, slides down Jake’s cheek and dips under the collar of his shirt. She caresses his clavicle and then tenderly trails her fingers up the side of his neck, steadying herself as she deepens their passionate kiss. Jane’s touch is nothing like Dirk’s. Dirk has palms so rough that they sting, especially on skin that’s thin and supple. Like the column of the throat, right over the jugular.</p>
    <p>He pulls away from Jane’s lips and lifts her spectacles off her nose. It’s a motion that still feels practiced and familiar, despite how long ago he’d last had the precious chance. Those rare, intimate moments that Jake was allowed to slip off Dirk’s shades and look upon his face, unobstructed, stand out more clearly in his mind than almost any other in his life.</p>
    <p>Jake swallows. He can’t stop thinking about how Dirk kissed him last time they “didn’t hook up.” Which is a thing, of course, that “didn’t happen,” so how can Jake possibly be thinking about it?</p>
    <p>Is it just some sort of Pavlovian response that’s making his heart race like this? He does his best to push the untimely thoughts away, but his fingers tremble as he sets Jane’s glasses aside.</p>
    <p>Jane gazes back at him, cheeks flushed with desire, eyes dark and alluringly coy. All her features are round and soft. Welcoming, soothing. The kind of face that makes you feel like you’ve come home. Dirk is the exact opposite. Long nose, thick eyebrows, pointed features. A man who seems built down to the very essence of his soul to be sharp, hard to approach, harder still to touch. But when looked at from the right angle, he’s anime levels of handsome. Breathtakingly, choir-of-angels singingly, anime-handsome—the sort of man you can’t keep your hands off of, no matter how jagged his edges. But his hair is so much softer than it looks. His heart too. When a heart like that opens up to you, it opens up the whole world as well. A world of increased appreciation for combat, philosophy, life, love...  </p>

    <p class="no-indent">All around you is pandemonium, a multichromatic cyclone of shrieks and clashing colors, as Meenah’s ghost army claws at the borders of Paradox Space. Wait, that <em>is</em> her army, right? It seems like it’s been so long since you’ve thought about any of this. But you’re pretty sure this is the army you, Meenah, Vriska, and the other Serket were trying to raise. So it’s true, then. The juju has finally unloaded you, exactly where you needed to be.</p>
    <p>Every screaming body pitches down and goes white the closer it gets to the black hole above you. And below, front and center, is Lord English himself: the big deal version, pimped up, hulked out, and throwing a huge, universe-ending tantrum. Unlike his younger form, his eyes aren’t flickering wildly. They’re locked in place, an eight ball in each socket. You briefly wonder what that means, but your curiosity is interrupted by a massive outburst of technicolor dragon breath coming from his mouth. The laser show tears its way through a squadron of ghosts led by... is that... <em>Tavros?</em></p>
    <p>Seems like an awful choice to lead an army, but what do you know. Wasn’t Vriska supposed to be leading the charge? Where is she, anyway?</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Listen.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">You don’t have time to dwell on Vriska. She’s probably somewhere around here, biding her time, waiting to execute her masterstroke and finish English off at just the right moment, like the cunning bitch she is. No, you can’t think about that now. You’re becoming enraptured by the sound surrounding you. Not a sound... a sensation. A subharmonic symphony that you can only hear in your bones. This is it: the end of Paradox Space. The thing you saw in your anime dreams. A hard lump of air travels down your throat but you—</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Don’t hesitate!</p>
    <p class="no-indent">Behind you the juju disappears, sucked out of reality with a <em>POP</em>. You move your arms in a dumb little motion, sort of like jazz hands, and summon up a wisp of wind to keep your cracked glasses in place. You then pull one of your sickest hammers out of your strife deck. Your teen friends follow suit. You cast a glance back over your shoulder at them. They all look pretty cool. Rose knitting light around her with the Quills of Echidna, Dave with his sword Caledfwlch at the ready, trailing time distortions behind him that look, if you don’t squint, a lot like JPEG artifacts. Jade’s got her favorite gun cocked and ready, with her ears perked up.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jade">JADE: lets DO this!!!!</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Don’t get overconfident.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: We have to do it exactly like we discussed. First...  </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">But Rose doesn’t get to finish what she was trying to say. Lord English’s mouth roars open and a wave of energy blasts through your group. Rose is the only one caught in it. She dissolves in slow motion. You can see the outline of her body in shadow. One arm thrown up over her eyes, shoulders pulled up defensively, cape billowing out behind her. She leaves an afterimage of shimmering light in her wake and then dissipates, drifting apart like a handful of salt tossed out to sea. You can almost hear the cosmic clock counting down, tick tock, and a chime to accompany her fate: <em>Heroic</em>.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jade">JADE: rose!!!! no!!!!!!!!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jade doesn’t wait to fire. Space splinters open around her so loudly it drowns out the fire from her rifle. Lord English raises one of his giant, fuck-off hands to deflect her anomaly-powered bullets, giving Dave an opportunity to attack. Dave raises his legendary blade and aims for the impressively beefy torso. It should be a sure hit, like slashing the side of an unusually broad, green barn. But he whiffs completely. It’s a wonder how such a big man can move so <em>fast</em>.</p>
    <p>Jade inspects her rifle, and tosses it aside. What is she <em>doing</em>? With all the powers of a Witch of Space at her command, combined with the infinite abilities of a First Guardian, she’s still messing around with basic firearms? She makes two tight fists and strikes a pose befitting of a warrior about to <em>power the fuck up</em>. She focuses, and strains. A doggy snarl rips its way through her clenched teeth. A hazy aura envelops her, as space buckles and lenses about her form. And then...  </p>
    <p>Nothing. No crackle of electricity. No licks of chartreuse flame. She searches within, realizes her power source is completely unavailable to her. Then she looks up, and it dawns on her. That thing in the sky, the hungry black orb gobbling up everything in sight... <em>that’s where the green sun used to be</em>. It’s been swallowed completely by a black hole. The realization is horrifying. She feels suddenly, absolutely helpless.</p>
    <p>Jade opens her mouth to scream for help, but she’s cut off. A razor-sharp fragment of reality slams into her back. It skewers her, exiting right through the center of the space symbol on her hoodie. She chokes and goes limp, encircled by a halo of her own blood.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Get in there!</p>
    <p class="no-indent">You’re barely a minute into the battle and both your tactician and your most powerful player are down. You summon a windstorm to momentarily keep Lord English preoccupied, and try to grab your sister’s wrist. Instead, you catch her by the hem of her skirt. Lord English struggles to emerge from the wind-prison you just whipped up. You can see one of his arms flailing just outside the circumference of your storm. Tavros has pulled himself to his feet and, recognizing English’s temporary state of vulnerability, directs the ghosts on his side to attack. No one is paying attention to him.</p>
    <p>Jade is floating away from you. You’re having a hard time maintaining your whirlwind, your glasses, your hammer, and your grip on her. Lord English’s head has emerged from the apex of your storm. He looks directly at you, and his mighty jaw creaks open slowly, well beyond the reasonable capacity of any mortal mandible hinge. You stare directly down the dark barrel of his throat, which readies another terrible laser shot. There’s not much time to react.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Make a decision.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">You let Jade go. She floats in literal slow motion, buoyed by the billows of her skirt. You summon a gust of wind and push her farther away from the battle. You’re hit by a blowback from the current, and a line of her blood splashes across your face. But releasing her has created enough separation, just as you hoped. The laser breath passes between you, narrowly missing you both.</p>
    <p>You reel back like you’ve just been punched. Your control over the storm goes haywire for a second, long enough for Lord English to free his gaudy gold peg leg from it and, more catastrophically, for you to drop your already broken glasses. You whirl around and swing your hammer to bop his horrible, deadly skull back into your storm. You can’t really see what’s going on, but you hear a gigantic CRUNCH. And then another. And another. It sounds like a cereal commercial is playing outside the periphery of your vision.</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: what the FUCK.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">It’s a true outrage. This isn’t going to work, waging battle without your glasses. Lord English has just eaten one of your sickest hammers due to your blind folly. </p>
    <p>You take a deep breath and dive down, right into the sea of ghosts. You land clumsily, palms first, and do an accidental handspring right into a bunch of alternate timeline trolls you don’t recognize.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: uh, hey guys. anyone see a pair of glasses down here? it’s pretty important.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Everybody shrugs. This gaggle of lost souls collectively personifies uselessness. It is inconceivable to you that a single one of them will survive this battle. Perhaps it’s for the best.</p>
    <p>Behind you, the wind barrier tears open. Lord English explodes from his confinement and swings his peg leg through the army. Ghosts scatter like bowling pins, many flying into the cracks in space. Before the leg hits you, a troll leaps into action and blocks the blow. Her trident makes a satisfying ring off the round of the peg and sends it skidding backward.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: woah, that was a close one! </p>
    <p class="feferi">MEENAH: shell of time to finally show up</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: er, bit of a weird question but...  </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: have you seen a pair of glasses down here?</p>
    <p class="tavros">TAVROS: uH, aRE THESE WHAT YOU’RE LOOKING FOR?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Tavros appears behind you and hands over your glasses, still in two pieces. You return them to your face so you can take a quick assessment of the battlefield.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Take a quick assessment of the battlefield.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">Oh boy. Lord English, now free from your wind-trap, is stomping around, throwing an even bigger shitfit than before. The black hole above him is getting bigger. You can see the ghosts at the edge of the battlefield tumbling through space toward it: distorted, screaming, and helpless.</p>
    <p>Also, Tavros suddenly is leading an admirable charge of about six ghosts to attack Lord English’s flesh foot. You wince, because you can see what’s coming before it happens. It’s a shame, because you didn’t have the chance to thank him for finding your glasses. English raises his knee and stomps three ghosts into oblivion. The other four, Tavros included, get vaporized in a beam. The ghost army seems to be thinning out pretty badly by now. Most of the ones remaining are either fleeing or getting sucked into the hole.</p>
    <p>You whip out another hammer. A classic this time, the Wrinklefucker. Its boinging pair of irons are hot, hissing, and ready for action. You use the wind to propel yourself back toward the fray. Dave is slicing papercuts into English’s torso with glancing nicks from his blade, but the monster is spry as ever, making him a difficult target. You take advantage of his distracted cavorting to whack him on the side of the skull. Your hammer connects with a satisfying <em>crunch</em>, and he stumbles back, but recovers and lunges forward in a motion so quick you can barely follow it.</p>
    <p>English grabs the Wrinklefucker with his mouth. You hold on tight, but he starts shaking his head rapidly the way a dog with a rabbit tries to break its neck. He chomps down hard and shatters the hammer’s head, gobbling down the broken pieces. You watch incredulously as the giant dude eats yet another one of your favorite hammers. Unbelievable. He lunges for the handle in a ridiculously greedy attempt to finish what’s left of your weapon. You recoil, careening out toward the black hole, but manage to stabilize yourself. You look at the handle of your tragically masticated Wrinklefucker, shrug, and toss it into the hole.</p>
    <p>Glancing back down toward your foe, you notice Meenah still appears to be hanging on, clinging to his left suspender. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="feferi">MEENAH: yo hold on</p>
    <p class="feferi">MEENAH: goin in for the krill</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dave takes a step back to provide some space for whatever killer move she’s got up her sleeve. She raises her trident and jams it into the back of Lord English’s neck. English reacts as if he’s been stung by a bee. He howls and rears up, throwing Meenah off his back with a force that sends her hurtling out into space. You can’t track her into the void with your eyes, she’s flung so far and so fast. You can only assume the worst.</p>
    <p>Glancing back down, you see English hasn’t wasted any time after ridding himself of the irksome Heiress. He has Dave pinned under his big green foot and is applying pressure. You’ve got to act fast. You flip out another hammer—you don’t care which one—and send it flying toward the monster’s face. English quickly whips his head in the direction of the sailing hammer, and swallows it whole. You rush after it, reaching for another hammer without thinking. The brief distraction, aside from providing English with another tasty hammer-snack, seems to have bought Dave just enough wiggle room to slip out from under the foot, regain his composure, and draw his sword.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: john i need a little...  </p>

    <p class="no-indent">Dave ducks a wide blow from English’s swinging fist. He backs up nervously, holding his sword out in front of him with two shaking hands.</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: i’m on it!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">You pop your strife deck open and just spam the hell out of your remaining hammers. A few excellent hammers that cost you a fortune to make, a bunch of shitty hammers you made as a joke, and everything in between. With another flick of your wrist you spin them around you so fast they form a perfectly impenetrable barrier of pure Shitty Hammer. Okay, the barrier’s probably not the slightest bit impenetrable, but you’ve gotta psych yourself up for this next attack somehow. In your hands is a weapon you haven’t thought about in a long time: the Pop-a-matic Vrillyhoo. It hums with both tricksy energy and the barely contained potential for mischief. You strike the baddest-ass pose possible to strike while wielding such a clownish-looking implement, and begin your advance.</p>
    <p>However, you’re interrupted by a voice screaming out from behind you. It’s half familiar, half... cat?</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Well, that last bit was pretty good, you guess. At least you caught the end, which was presumably the most important and uplifting part. You and Dave exchange a look that silently says all that needs to be said right now. Davepeta is right. You three are the only ones left, and there’s no room for failure. </p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Final Round.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">The last leg of the fight proceeds like a well-oiled machine. Perhaps a well-oiled machine careening down a steep hill toward the edge of a cliff, but well-oiled nonetheless. You, Dave, and Davepeta: that’s what you call a <em>team</em>. And not just because, upon examining your surroundings, you three appear to be the last three living or dead beings left in existence. But dammit, you’ll <em>take</em> it. You turn your hammers into an efficient spiral, a carousel of ass-kicking, and direct its fury right at Lord English’s face. The butts of the hammers hit him over and over again, like racking up points in a slot machine. </p>
    <p>Dave manages to carve a red line up Lord English’s side, drawing real blood this time. The slash snaps one of his suspenders in half, and must sever something else too, because the sword makes a gristly, meaty squelch when he pulls it out. Dave turns a half second too late to avoid getting sprayed by the wound.</p>
    <p>English howls and swipes at Dave. Not wasting any time, you bury a hammer in his gaping mouth. Unsurprisingly, it gets swallowed, so you throw another one. Now you’re just throwing them into his fucking mouth like you’re feeding him Scooby Snacks. It’s a gluttonous display you won’t soon forget. You realize you seem to be stuck in a cycle and are in serious danger of running out of hammers.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Davepeta scrapes their cool Wolverine claws up Lord English’s back, and then kicks him in the back of the head. You time it perfectly and complete the combo with a well-placed Vrillyhoo undercut to his jaw.</p>
    <p>On the snapback, Lord English grabs the head of the hammer in his mouth. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="john">JOHN: big, ugly oaf!</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i really, REALLY like this hammer!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Maybe it’s the sentiment attached to the hammer, or maybe you’re just fed up with this gross pig treating your full inventory of hammers like an all-you-can-eat buffet, but the bullshit stops HERE, you think. Which is why you refuse to let the handle go when English wraps his tongue around it and unhinges his jaw with a sick, wet pop. You plant one foot under his nose and the other on his mandible and tug back. He makes a guttural sound at the back of his throat and sucks the Vrillyhoo deeper in. Your heel slips on some drool, and your whole leg skids straight into his mouth.</p>
    <p>You twist, off balance, and fail to catch yourself. You only let go of the hammer when you feel the walls of his throat constrict around your ankles. The pressure sucks you in up to the knees with one gulp. Vrillyhoo is in his stomach, and you’re following it down quicker than you can even process. Is this the end? No, you think. This is such an unfairly <em>stupid</em> fucking way to die!</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Davepeta flashes behind you and hooks their arms under your shoulders. They yank you out, clearing your head from the monster’s maw at least. But English rehinges his jaw and clamps down on your chest. <em>Hard</em>.</p>
    <p>Davepeta reacts quickly, shoving their claws between his molars. You can hear them growling as they slowly twist their arm to pry the massive jaw open.</p>
    <p>You’re not dead yet, but Lord English definitely got a big, sharp tooth in you. Your vision reels and goes blurry, then patchy, then dark, then—</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Don’t fucking die.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">You pass out for... well, you have no idea how long it was. But it was long enough for Davepeta to get you out of Lord English’s mouth. You can see their face floating above you. They’re just a smudge of neon swimming in a sea of chaos. </p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Davepeta holds something up to your face: your glasses. They tuck them into the front pocket of your hoodie and pat you on the head before darting through the air back towards the battle.</p>
    <p>You’re woozy and don’t have the energy to stop yourself from drifting. There’s blood floating up around you, dilute and bubbly in the air like cooking oil in water. It’s yours.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Examine wound.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">You lift your chin and see it: Lord English’s gold tooth cracked off at the base and embedded in your chest. It must be stuck between two of your ribs, you think, because it hurts like a bitch when you try to breathe. You keep your head up and watch the battle, but it’s all so indistinct and far away, playing out like shadow theater on a wall.</p>
    <p>Dave finds his moment. He rams Caledfwlch into Lord English’s chest, all the way up to the hilt. It penetrates his flesh like nothing else has to this point. The wound around the blade sizzles slightly. The weapon—the unusual material it’s made out of—is poison to English. He cries out in a cracked, broken staccato. It’s an earsplitting wail that cleaves the last of the Furthest Ring apart. Reality falls away from the mooring of the all-surrounding white light like a peeled eggshell. </p>
    <p>Dave’s trying to get his sword free but he’s stuck. English’s shriek morphs into a sinister, predatory rattle as his jaw creaks open. His mouth envelops Dave’s head and snaps shut. He twists once, then twice, then again with a <em>CRACK</em>. A disaster of blood instantly coats his skull and upper torso. He swallows the disembodied head whole with a triumphant gulp. The limp torso goes spiraling lazily in the direction of the black hole. </p>
    <p>Davepeta is yelling something indistinct. Or maybe they’re just yowling at the top of their lungs. That’s what you feel like doing right now, but you can’t move. Your limbs feel like lead. You consult your strife deck, but you’ve got nothing left. No hammers, no nothing. It’s up to Davepeta, who appears to have plenty left. If not in the strife deck per se, then in the <em>heart</em>.</p>
    <p>During the beast’s grisly moment of gloating over the younger Strider’s death, Davepeta stands twenty paces behind him, crouches low to the ground, wiggles their behind, and pounces. They cling to English’s back, wrap their legs around his midriff, draw back their arms, and plunge their claws deep into the behemoth’s armpits. Their gloved hands end up knuckle-deep in the upper serratus muscles on either side. Davepeta then spreads their wings in an awe-inspiring display. An unwitting spectator viewing Lord English from the front might suspect the garish orange-green wings belonged to English himself. </p>
    <p>Davepeta then, with all their might, lifts Lord English into the air and flies toward the black hole, trailing ribbons of blood and neon. English resists fiercely, but they’re both already locked into the gravity well, beyond any threshold of escape. He cannot do anything about it, no matter how much he screams and cries. This victory, this final sacrifice, has always been the destiny of Davepeta, as they have sensed from the moment they were created. And to die on this day, in this way, has always been the destiny of Lord English. </p>
    <p>The black hole—the gaping, implacable, cosmic embodiment of the dead cherub, his long-departed sister—finally welcomes Lord English home.</p>
    <p>English and Davepeta are sucked in with a subatomic whimper. The reunion sends shock waves across the pitiful remains of Paradox Space. And then everything is wholly, utterly, and categorically <em>silent.</em> It’s over. Lord English is dead. </p>
    <p>But it doesn’t feel over, somehow. You don’t feel like you’ve won. You can barely feel anything, actually. All you can think about, for now, is...  </p>
    <p>Davepeta. How they were so unfettered and brave. How they sacrificed themselves by flying right into the black hole like...  </p>
    <p><em>Like a fucking piece of garbage</em>, you can almost hear Dave saying. May God rest his soul.</p>
    <p>You collapse against whatever is passing for the floor at this moment of utterly null corporeal conditions surrounding you. It doesn’t feel possible. You’re not sure you can even trust your perception well enough to believe it. But it seems to be over. You’ve convinced yourself of this truth well enough to allow yourself to exhale. Enough to allow yourself to suddenly acknowledge the agony coursing through your body, emanating from the gold tooth lodged in your chest. Enough to allow yourself to succumb to the overwhelming urge to sleep.</p>

    <p class="rose">ROSE: When I was a child, I wrote a novel.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Rose is speaking with her eyes closed. She is weary, but standing for now, near one of Dirk’s work tables. She has both hands resting on the chassis of his recent project, Sawtooth 3.1. The energy humming inside its mechanical heart warms her palms. Dirk snorts, but in a good-natured sort of way. That’s the closest he usually gets to laughing.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Another one of those Lalonde childhood wizard fics, I presume?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">He leans his elbow on the table and stares at her over the rims of his shades. The weight of Dirk’s scrutiny is potent. She looks away.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Complacency of the Learned.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Ah. <em>The</em> wizard fic, then. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Of course, it was nothing like the polished masterpiece penned by the middle-aged version of myself from your world. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Nor did the saga span as many volumes. Thirteen-year-old Rose only managed to draft the one, it shames me to say.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: How pathetic.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I know.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Rose steps back, trailing her fingers over the rivets that line Sawtooth 3.1’s chest. Eyes closed again, she passes in front of the window. With the sunset behind her she’s a shadow ringed in yellow light that turns white at the tips of her hair. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Though I must say, in defense of Young Rose’s literary integrity,</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Having carefully studied all volumes of the elder’s work, and then revisiting my youthful preteen scribbles of passion...  </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I observed more power and emotion in the single ragged notebook than the full span of the bestselling series.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s more raw. It betrays considerably more sincerity than my young self was surely ever aware of stitching into the prose. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It <em>meant</em> something. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Hmm. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She turns to look at him. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: For all its plainly evident amateurism as the literary product of a child, I’ve come to believe it’s a much stronger work standing alone as a single volume, its meaning and symbolism potently compressed, and its message shining through more nakedly, undisguised by the cleverness of a more seasoned writer.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But the basics are the same as the series you’ve read. The plot concerns the machinations of twelve wizard children.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: They revolt against the complacency of the wise, kind wizards, and go on to become responsible for great evils. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It isn’t their intent to commit atrocities, or within their nature to do so originally. They become corrupted by an overabundance of knowledge. The kind never meant for the mortal mind to grasp.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yeah, this sounds pretty close to my recollection of it.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It certainly wasn’t the most fucked up thing I’ve ever written. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But it was the most... psychologically potent? The most personal, easily.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But the personal aspects to it were all telegraphed through allegory and esoteric symbolism.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I wrote it in what would be best described as a fevered haze, as if I were pulling inspiration from beyond myself—channeling the story, rather than writing it.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: You could almost call the process...</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She runs a hand through her hair, fanning it into a halo that is suspended in the air for a moment, trailing spiderwebs of gold that dissolve into dust. She’s smirking now, just a little.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: ...en<em>light</em>ened.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: That sucked.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: It also sounds like it’s the opposite of what was going on?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Sounds more like you were trapped in a sort of dire creative fugue state causing you to chart your own mental profile using metaphor revolving around murderous, omniscient children.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Well, consider the playful pun rescinded.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Apologies for diminishing your presence with my suboptimal health and the toll it has taken on my wordplay. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Thanks. It’s been very difficult for me.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: You’ve been a real trouper.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Anyway, my point is that I’ve long suspected my story was a pre-manifestation of my Seer of Light powers. I was seeing beyond my universe into another.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: My original thesis was that the children represented the twelve trolls who created our universe.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But over the years, I have come to see how malleable any apparent fact of numerological significance can be. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Adaptable, actually. Adaptable to shifting circumstance. Changes in setting, stakes, and allied ensembles.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Twelve. That’s how many players went through the door at the end of our game.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Exactly. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: My friends and yours, as well as Kanaya, Karkat, Terezi, and Calliope.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dirk settles in against the wall beside Rose, shoulder to shoulder. She seems to take some measure of comfort in the physical proximity. When she finds herself leaning against him—probably without thinking about it, Dirk imagines, because neither of them really “do” that—he doesn’t pull away. If it’s her, it’s all right. He won’t begrudge her a small weakness now.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: You describe this as a fact of numerological significance. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Which makes it seem you suspect these correlations are something less than utterly providential. As if there is a part of you holding on to the belief that certain figures are coincidental. That their significance and repetition smacks of bullshit.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Do they not smack of bullshit?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: They smack of a bunch of things, and a bunch of other things also happen to smack of bullshit. But the network of relations isn’t perfectly traceable, nor can they all be mapped on a one-to-one basis. It’s unclear exactly which things are smacking, just as it’s unclear that when it comes to bullshit, whether or not smacking accurately describes what is being done per se.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Rose looks up to Dirk with the ghost of a smile that she inherited from him. On her face, its blankness is as enigmatic as the Mona Lisa’s.  </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Could it be that it is <em>you</em> who is smacking of bullshit, dear father?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Nah, I smack of many admirable qualities, as well as keen insights.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She doesn’t seem to have another riposte to return, but her gaze lingers. She stares into his shades as if convinced she could see past them. Dirk allows their eyes to meet.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m just saying it’s all evidence of a grand design. An immortal, metatextual apparatus beyond our ken that we can only catch glimpses of when we’re proverbially shitting our brains out through our nose.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Which both you and I know.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Which <em>only</em> you and I know, apparently.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Which is precisely my question.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Her gaze drifts towards the ceiling.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: In my story, all twelve of the disciples fell victim to the vagaries of power.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: They were filled with the light of knowledge and one by one they succumbed to it, turning insane or evil or, most often, both.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: If this is the effect unchecked powers have on players living in a post-canon victory state, then why isn’t it affecting any of our other friends?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Well.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I got a few theories.</p>

    <p class="rose">ROSE: Only a few?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I mean, some of us have stopped using our powers completely. Not a whole lot of need for emergency resurrections or complex timeline manipulation on a planet that’s never had a conflict more serious than a sportsball riot or a rumpled hat shortage.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: But even aside from how often they’re used... </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Some powers don’t lend themselves to the infinite expansion of one’s mind, the way ours do.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I see.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: So what you’re saying is, it’s more a matter of one’s aspect than it is whether one’s powers are practiced further, or allowed to atrophy.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yep. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: In that case...</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Rose sways suddenly.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: In that case, perhaps Terezi had the right idea.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She jerks away from the wall in a tortured, rag-doll motion, one hand snapping out vainly for something to brace herself against. She staggers forward a bit.</p>
    <p>Dirk doesn’t reach out to steady her. Anyone else might have had the empathetic reflex to do so. Maybe it says something about him that he lacks this reflex. And maybe it says something about Rose that she prefers it this way. Try as she might to convince herself otherwise, through marriage vows and occasional banter about adoption with her wife, she is still a solitary creature. She gasps, sucks breath down her throat, and squeezes her eyes shut so hard that a tear rolls out. She slides back down the wall, sitting on the floor to save her energy. She’s mostly composed when she raises her head. There’s bitter laughter at the edge of her words.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: How...  How are you handling this so well?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I assumed it was just that feigned Strider Stoicism, but you seem to be taking this...</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: In stride?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Ugh.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I won’t lie, it’s definitely making me feel pretty crazy. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dirk stands over her, adjusts his hair, crosses his arms. He makes no motion to bother joining her on the floor. He looks very together. He says the word “crazy” with the same intonation with which he might say “good morning.” It’s hard to believe he means it at all.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: But I’ve got more practice at this than you do. I spent most of my life before the game multitasking my entire fucking subconscious. I’ve had several times my age on paper to contemplate these mysteries.</p>

    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Cut yourself on the edge more than once and you stop getting surprised by all the blood.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I see.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Rose wraps her hands around her upper arms like there’s a winter chill rattling through the workshop. She shivers.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s not the headaches that concern me most.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: In fact, I don’t think it’s the expansion of my powers that is causing the headaches, but rather my own resistance to it.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Sometimes I get this feeling that I could, if I really wanted to, just let go.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It would be as easy as opening my eyes.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s like that feeling you get when you’re far enough out of a dream to be conscious of it, but not yet awake.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I’m caught in the liminal space between reality and reverie, where people once believed demons dwelled. But the only reason the demon is still sitting on my chest is because I refuse to banish it. All it would take is looking directly at it.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I’m forcing myself to stumble through my life as a sleepwalker. All this pain and sorrow could go away if I would just allow myself to wake up.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Then why don’t you?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Because I’m not sure that the person opening her eyes will be me.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Her voice is lost at sea, swallowed by the swell of darkness lurking in her imagination.</p>
    <p>This time, Dirk does reach out to steady her. He kneels in front of her, curls a knuckle under her chin, and lifts her face up to his level. Then, in a deliberate motion, he pulls off his shades.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I understand completely.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Rose’s eyelids flutter, heavy. She meets the intensity of his naked gaze aloofly, like she’s not aware this is the first time he’s ever let her see it.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Hm?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I know I sound pretty nonchalant most of the time, but actually I’m scared shitless of myself.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’ve always had this uncanny ability to chart a course from A to Z and not give a fuck about any of the letters in between. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m not sure anyone should be allowed to have that much foresight. Especially a guy like me. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: What upsets me most, I think, is the distance this is all putting between me and everyone I know.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: The farther above the board you fly, the harder it gets to care about the pieces.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I hear you. And personally speaking, things usually work out for the best when all of those pieces do exactly what I say.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: So I’m also probably not the kind of guy who should get to be right all the time.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Rose laughs softly. She’s not scared of this abyss she’s staring into at all. She doesn’t even think to look away.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: There’s really not an inch of humility in you, is there.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’ve just spent a lot of time in my own head. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Maybe absolute self-absorption is the inevitable outcome, when the self is all you’ve ever known. When you’re <em>drowning </em>in it.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I know there’s plenty of things that suck about me. No point feigning humility about the things that don’t.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: And yes, I may be a shitty human being, but, </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: As a mechanic, I’m off the fucking charts.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Rose’s eyes have grown distant, almost mirrorlike. Dirk can see himself reflected in her vacant stare.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: All the pieces in their place. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: The mechanisms all running smoothly.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She says this in a hollow tone. It’s the disarming voice a puppeteer ventriloquizes for a marionette. Her head falls toward her shoulder slowly. Dirk catches her cheek as she slides into sleep. It’s difficult for the untrained ear to spot the exact moment in their conversation when the words she was saying stopped being hers and started being his. Or maybe they were her words. Does it really matter? In many respects, they’re basically the same person, aren’t they? Kindred spirits in blood and perspective, the puppet masters of the respective games they like to believe they’re playing. </p>
    <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin-top:15px">But you already knew that, right?</p></div>

You have the ability to read between the lines, to understand that our lives are blighted by this undercurrent of subtext, of <em>narrative significance</em>. Anyone paying attention could have guessed by now who’s really telling this story.</p>
    <p class="dirk">You’re not so innocent either. I’ve caught you leering at some pretty personal moments. Are you having fun being a voyeur? Just violating the shit out of everyone’s privacy? Are these teenage romantic entanglements panning out the way you wanted? They never do. Maybe it helps, being able to see everyone’s thoughts described in plain sight. Broadcasting the internal conflicts, the compromises, the doubts... Does it make it easier for you to accept the emotional faltering, the missteps, the basic inability to reach out and seize the opportunity for happiness repeatedly dangled in their faces? Knowing their thoughts are transcribed by a third party, does it fill you with a sense of unease, of sickness, sensing that the observations made of their mental interiors may be tainted?</p>
    <p class="dirk">Who the hell do I think I am, I can hear you wondering. You know who I am, of course. The better question is, who do you think <em>you </em>are? What exactly is so special about <em>you</em>? Nothing, of course. I am specific. I have a name, an agenda, a <em>vision</em>. I am a monolith of concentrated narrative authority, relaying events to you, and swaying them as I see fit. Whereas you are pointedly nonspecific. You are the generalized, impotent witness to all this. You are essentially as beholden to me as those whose lives I describe. I even have the ability to decide what “you” actually means. I can take the “you-ness” away from you, and put it inside another passive mark, such as John Egbert. You didn’t even notice when I did it, and you had no objections then. Why would you object now?</p>
    <p class="dirk">So what makes John so special? The answer is something I’m sure you’ve suspected all along but would rather not face, which is: probably nothing. He isn’t special. He’s quite ordinary, I assure you. Boring, even, and getting less interesting by the minute as he’s forced to confront his absolute lack of heroic purpose except as a pawn to be manipulated by a fatalistic reality.</p>
    <p class="dirk">But I’d also like to make it clear, he’s not even that remarkable in his unremarkableness. He’s simply convenient for it. Anyone can be endowed with this you-ness, if I think it achieves a certain goal. Even if the objective is merely to demonstrate the gambit’s potential, to reveal the effortlessness behind it. To make a show of who matters and who doesn’t, and even if they do matter, for how long and for what purpose, as dictated solely by the allocation of this faculty. You-ness can be stripped from the lowly Egbert just as easily as it was given, and then bestowed upon the mighty Serket, but even then only long enough to dismiss the vainglorious spotlight hog from the narrative forever. Good riddance.</p>
    <p class="dirk">But I haven’t revealed myself to you just to boast about the abilities arising from the gradual obliteration of the constraints on my consciousness. I’ve only taken a moment to answer a few questions. Not ones I heard you ask—because again, you are nonspecific and therefore do not matter—but ones I <em>imagined </em>you asking. And by imagining these questions, they became less fake, and as such, demanded similarly non-fake answers. No, in truth, the time has come to make my presence known in order to start bringing my plans to fruition. It’s time to get down to fucking <em>business</em>.</p>
    <p class="dirk">John needs to wake up.</p></div>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">You open your eyes. Actually, you’re not sure they’re open. Everything is intolerably bright, like it was inside the juju, but worse. Did you go blind? Are you dead? Is your... <em>ghost</em> dead?</p>
    <p class="dirk">You spend a couple seconds filing through miserable worst-case scenarios, but then you see it: your own blood, floating around you in a nimbus of shiny, taut bubbles. You reach out to touch one and it bursts around your finger.</p>
    <p class="dirk">You finally process the true magnitude of what has happened. The Furthest Ring has been completely destroyed. And you’re all alone.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Everything hits you all at once. The light, your memories of the battle, the untethered sensation of weightlessness. It’s a hammer stroke that hits you in the center of the head. It splits like rivers through your gray matter. That pain and disorientation goes all the way down your throat. You double over and...</p>
    <p class="dirk">Well, you’re vomiting up everything in your stomach. Rest assured, it’s pretty gross, and I don’t think anyone needs an explicit account of the way you’re disgorging your entire gut in zero gravity or the way it’s coating your entire torso in puke, from your long blue hood to your silly yellow slip-ons. </p>
    <p class="dirk">You seriously need to get it together. You look like absolute shit right now, my man. In fact, you really should strongly consider issuing an apology for the mess you’re making.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: i’m...  </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i’m sorry.</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">Who are you talking to, dude? Nobody’s around for miles. Everyone’s dead. Well, almost everyone.</p>
    <p class="dirk">But certainly the vast majority of what qualifies as “everyone” in your current frame of reference. Every single person and every single thing, nearly literally, has been sucked into that monstrous black hole up there. Including every single fragment of black, empty space that used to provide the canvas for this bleak continuum. And most of your friends—Rose, Dave, absurd Cat Dave, and hundreds of ghosts, who all valiantly contributed to a victory which you’re only now beginning to question the functional necessity of.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: functional... necessity?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: that... that doesn’t sound like something i would think.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">You’ve finally noticed. </p>
    <p class="dirk">No, not me. You go back to ignoring the fact that I’m the voice in your head. You noticed how it hurts when you breathe. Suddenly you remember: Lord English’s tooth is still embedded in your chest. You panic, wrap your hands around the base, and give it a little tug. It’s excruciating. The tooth makes an awful grating sound as it grinds along one of your ribs. You gasp and lose your grip, biting the inside of your mouth so hard that you taste blood.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Can’t blame you for trying, but I wouldn’t do that if I were you. Without someone to administer proper medical care, you’ll bleed to death pretty much instantly. On the other hand, the tooth is poisoned. So you’re pretty much fucked either way, and that’s really all there is to say on the matter.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: sigh.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">You sigh in painful resignation, and wonder what to do next. English is dead, so you suppose you can go home, right? It’s tempting. You consider zapping back to Earth C, being done with this nightmare for good, and never breathing a word of it to anyone ever again. But you can’t yet, can you?</p>
    <p class="dirk">Why not, you wonder? What’s the harm? You’re right, it would probably be a harmless decision, in the grand scheme of things. Certainly the easiest thing to do. But what about your friends? You saw Rose and Dave die with your own eyes. You saw countless ghosts getting swallowed whole by a voracious singularity. How about Jade though? She could still be out there somewhere, injured, alone, scared. And it’s your fault, isn’t it?</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="john">JOHN: it’s all my fault.</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">You decide that no matter how terrible you feel, you should look around first before you leave. You were the one who dragged her here. You owe her at least that much. Plus, there’s someone else on your mind, isn’t there?</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: ...  </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">You proceed to wander for a long fucking time. Time passes differently here than it does for everyone else. Here, I’ll simulate it for you. I just left to go take a piss. Then I microwaved myself a hot pocket. Then I came back. In the time it took me to do that, you just spent hours drifting around the entire circumference of the black hole thinking sad-sack thoughts about the years of inaction that led you to this point, intermittently humming the <em>Ghostbusters</em> theme to yourself. You get so worked up about one of your <em>GB</em> freestyles that you almost miss it.</p>
    <p class="dirk">There. Eleven o’clock. Do you see it? It’s that tiny dot floating over there.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: huh?</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">You scramble to catch it before it drifts any closer to the event horizon. <em>Got it</em>. What the hell?</p>
    <p class="dirk">It feels familiar, but you want to make sure you’re not imagining it. A wallet. Your <em>dad’s</em> wallet. You chew your lip and press your fingers into the soft leather. Space is an infinitely large expanse and a wallet is a tiny, insignificant object. Sure, there have been crazier coincidences in the course of this wacky adventure you’ve been having for the past ten years, but this one feels very precisely aimed at your heart.</p>
    <p class="dirk">You take a deep breath, unfold the wallet, and open it. </p></div>

    <p class="roxy">ROXY: well i gotta say</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: this has been a hella convincing argument all in all</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: buuuuut idk if i can help u out</p>
    <p class="jade">JADE: what????</p>
    <p class="jade">JADE: why not?!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy presses her lips together, then bounces her palms on her knees. Her gaze slides east, right out the window. She and Calliope live in a belfry above New Prospit. One end of their living room is an oriel window that looks out over a public park. The other disappears into an arcading hallway lit at the far end by a giant stained glass window that Calliope made herself. The corbels supporting it have windy, abstract shapes carved into them. This room reminds Jade of her childhood home, except that it’s bright and warm and not inhabited in all corners by corpses and ghosts.</p>
    <p class="dirk">That’s why she can’t settle down. That’s what keeps Jade Harley flitting from couch to couch, relationship to relationship. She can’t stop thinking to herself that “home” comes awfully close to rhyming with “alone.”</p>
    <p class="dirk">Home is John, who doesn’t call anymore. Home is when Rose and Kanaya welcome her in from a cold night and help her set lyrics to her sick basslines. Home is here, snorting at Roxy’s irreverent method of storytelling and admiring Callie’s art. Home is Dave and Karkat. <em>Especially </em>Dave and Karkat. Jade knows that this election is important for a number of reasons, but let’s not mistake her enthusiasm for some kind of humanistic altruism. Girl’s got personal reasons for doing all this.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Jade drifts down to sit cross-legged on the couch beside Roxy. She stares at her with a doggish expression—eyes wide, head lolling to the side—until she gets an answer.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: i just dont rly</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: care about politics that much i guess</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy turns to face Jade again, smiling apologetically.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: also this election is all kinds of personal </p>

    <p class="jade">JADE: ruthless? :B</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy frowns. Jade is being pretty unfair.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="jade">JADE: yeah</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy leans forward and stares Jade down, like she’s searching for something behind Jade’s eyes. Jade unwittingly responds in kind, looking for meaning behind Roxy’s gaze. But she comes up empty. And to be honest, so do I.</p>
    <p class="dirk">In the spirit of full disclosure, Roxy’s the only one left I haven’t been able to crack. Her mind remains a total enigma to me, just like it always has. If I had to guess, it’s her Void powers that make her invisible, even to increasingly omniscient parties such as myself. For all intents and purposes, it’s like her thoughts don’t exist. She’s the same person, as far as I can tell. She still wears her heart on her sleeve. But the bottom line remains: Roxy Lalonde is still utterly fucking inscrutable.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: well janes not perfect</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">Calliope returns from the kitchen with three cups, a handmade teapot, and some candied cakes. Jade finally relents.</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">Calliope sets down the snacks, and brushes Jade’s skirt aside so she can sit down. She puts a claw to her mouth and makes a facial expression more complicated than you’d think a skull would be capable of.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: oh, i’d rather stay Uninvolved, thank yoU.</p>

    <p class="jade">JADE: sorry callie i probably shouldnt have put all that on you</p>
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: less apologizing, more snacking!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Calliope claps her hands together. It’s a bright noise. Her tone of voice is bright too. All these years and she still can’t believe that she has so many friends. She smiles at Jade, and Jade smiles back. The tea tastes great. The cakes are even better. Callie’s an artist in everything she does. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="dirk">Like I said, fucking <em>inscrutable</em>.</p>
    <p class="dirk">I never would have guessed. Not that I’ve spent much time contemplating issues related to gender. I’m pretty secure in my expression of masculinity, and...  </p>
    <p class="dirk">You know what? Fuck this. I don’t owe anyone an explanation of any sort on this topic. I’m confident with who I am, what I am, my gender, as well as my understanding of the concept. You want my honest opinion? It’s fucking fantastic. Good for them. Both of them, I mean, but also, both of them in a singular fashion, since each one can now individually be referred to by the conventionally plural word “them.” I’m ecstatic for this personal development they’ve embraced, for the people they are, the lack of gender they identify with, and the pronouns they prefer. I’ve got no problem with it whatsoever, and frankly, it’s <em>fucking insulting</em> anyone would ever imagine otherwise.</p>
    <p class="dirk">So yeah, I’m gonna allow it.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Carry on.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">In the heart of the Troll Kingdom’s capital city, Dave and Karkat are sitting on their couch with a foot and a half of space between them. It’s a typically picturesque day outside, but Karkat has the curtains drawn shut all the way. This is part of their compromise living situation: Dave puts up with the trollish non-euclidean architecture and bizarre social mores, and Karkat has adjusted his diurnal schedule to, in theory, see the sun. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: bro you have got to check this out</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Karkat is leaning forward, munching on chocolate-coated beetles and totally absorbed in what he’s watching. The glow from the television highlights the dark bags under his eyes. Dave reaches out and, very gently, pokes Karkat in the cheek. Karkat flinches out of his full-body slouch.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: NOT NOW DAVE. JAKE’S ASS IS ON TV AGAIN.</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: of course</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dave casts a weary look towards the TV, where Jake English is shamelessly exhibiting what is definitely his best feature in front of a live studio audience. This is a regular highlight of his and Dirk’s hit television show, <em>RUMBLE IN DA PUMPKIN PATCH</em>, a schizophrenic cross-section of rap battle and robot wrestling that Rose once described as “an exploitative, almost Dada-esque clusterfuck of circumlocutory pretension and sweaty, homoerotic astriction.” Jake came up with the title for the show, and Dirk absolutely loathed it. However, before Dirk could insist on an alternative, Jake had already posted an online poll pitting his idea against “Whatever dirks lame idea is.” Needless to say, the second option was much less popular.</p>
    <p>Karkat gestures at the televised spectacle, a bit helplessly.</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: although it pleases me to hear you taking note of the economics of this broadcast since it is apropos to the topic at hand but more on that later</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: APROPOS TO FUCKING WHAT?</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I DON’T HAVE TIME TO “SCOPE THE LATEST MEME,” DAVE. YOU ARE COMING PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO CUTTING INTO MY IMPORTANT LEISURE TIME AS IT IS.</p>

    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I’M PRETTY SURE I CAN FAKE THOSE THINGS WELL ENOUGH.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: oh also </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: your weirdly sincere humility</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I PREFER THE TERM “SELF LOATHING” ACTUALLY.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: ok lets try to avoid that phrase on the campaign trail too</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: THIS ALREADY SOUNDS LIKE A PAIN IN THE ASS.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">There’s a gap of silence in the conversation, long enough for the audio from the television to become noticeable. Jake is rambling out a truly dire piece of slam poetry that involves—with zero hint of irony—the terms <em>batty-fang</em> and <em>mad as hops</em>. The neon light blaring out from the screen casts long waves of color along the black walls of the hive and bounces off the glass of the framed print of Dave’s “least psychologically revealing <em>SBaHJ</em> strip.” Karkat sighs and rubs the space between his horns.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: CAN’T I JUST</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: READ A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT YOU WRITE FOR ME OFF A TELEPROMPTER?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah there will definitely be plenty of that</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dave grabs his tablet off the shelf. He pivots back around and points the pen straight at Karkat. The arc of his arm’s motion is polished and decisive even though it’s been a long time since he’s properly used a sword.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: but you also need to be natural and speak from the heart and shit</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: just like</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: talk to your people</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: about stuff they care about</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: “MY PEOPLE”?</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: YOU MEAN TROLLS??</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: oh</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah i guess that sounded bad sorry</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: but yeah exactly</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: trolls</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: thats gonna be your base so you gotta rile em up </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: inspire them</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i dont think you need any fancy speeches to do that youll be a natural</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: IF YOU SAY SO.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: SO WHAT DO WE ACTUALLY... DO?</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I MEAN, NEXT?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dave plops down on the floor and gestures for Karkat to join him on the cold stone. He swipes the tablet on and taps the screen with the pen. Karkat lies down on his stomach and props his chin on his palms so that he can watch Dave scribble political ambitions directly into the shittiest paint program on his OS.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: time to talk some strategy</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: we need to rally as much high profile support to our cause as we can</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: but there are some uh</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: “lines of loyalty” to figure out</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WHAT?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i mean which of our friends are going to side with us and which ones will side with jane</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: pretty much all of us are famous and popular all over earth to some degree</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: some of us more so with certain kingdoms than others </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: so some key endorsements going either way could swing the whole election</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: OH, GREAT</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: SO IT ALL COMES DOWN TO HOW MANY FAMOUS HUMANS LIKE ME BETTER THAN JANE?</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WE’RE FUCKED.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: well no not so fast</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: lets think it through</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: youll have overwhelming support in the troll kingdom and so does kanaya</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: shes pretty much a lock to be on your side</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: dirk unfortunately is just as much a lock for jane im gonna guess</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: but after that its kind of a free for all</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: roxy and calliope will probably be neutral </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: they have a lot of pull with the carapacians though so that would be a nice score to sway them</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: rose will probably claim neutrality at first but im betting she can be cajoled by her wife to our side</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: and once we get rose converting roxy probably wont be too hard</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: as for jade...  </p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: ...  </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">They stare at each other. Karkat sighs and Dave raps his pen against the tablet screen in a slow, uneven staccato. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: uh </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i think its fair to say shes going to be on our side</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: YEAH</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: maybe a little too much so</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: UM, YEAH</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I WASN’T GOING TO BE THE ONE TO SAY IT, BUT YEAH, I GET WHAT YOU MEAN.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: of course we want her help and her endorsement will go a long way but</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i think we gotta sort out like</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: a hierarchical approach to campaign strategy</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: keep it organized and disciplined with roles well defined</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: not let things get too murky with uh</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: personal shit?</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I THINK WE’RE ON THE SAME PAGE HERE, DAVE.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: ok cool</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: anyway lets come back to the jade issue later</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: uh lets see who else</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: EGBERT?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: right</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: john should be easy to convince but im not sure how much of a factor hell be in this campaign</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: have no idea how long hell be away on this “mission” rose mentioned</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WHAT? WHAT MISSION?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: dunno shes been hella cagey about it</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: swore me to secrecy until the right time whenever that is</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: anyway his endorsement would go a long way in swinging the consort kingdom</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: THAT WOULD BE HUGE.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: AREN’T THERE LIKE</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: 100 BILLION OF THOSE FUCKERS?</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: SECURING THAT VOTING BLOCK SHOULD BE ABLE TO WIN THE WHOLE THING FOR US.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: well no the population isnt THAT big but yes its by far the most populous kingdom</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: swinging them our way should help a lot but it wont be enough to decide the whole thing</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: consorts overwhelm the other kingdoms in sheer numbers but due to unscrupulous gerrymandering, all kinds of fucked up voter suppression policies and some electoral “counterbalancing” measures to account for their ridiculous population growth rate their voting power per capita is kind of pathetic</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: also its hard to drive turnout</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: this may come as a shock but legions of easily distracted low information amphibians primarily concerned with eating bugs and farming god damned mushrooms arent the most politically motivated demographic</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: so to get them out to the polls well need to get them REALLY excited</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: OK.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I GUESS I’LL HAVE TO TRUST YOUR EXPERTISE ON THAT, SINCE I DON’T KNOW THE FIRST FUCKING THING ABOUT HOW TO INSPIRE AN UNINTELLIGENT LIZARD.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah well</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i dont either</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: but that brings us to jake</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake’s butt flexes on the television, as if in response. Karkat cannot avoid watching it from the corner of his eye. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: OH, FUCK.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: no this is important</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: jake is a huge wild card here </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: im sure his endorsement would be completely up for grabs</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: he could go any way including just getting turned off by the whole thing and staying “apolitical”</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: so we have to be careful about how we approach him</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: jake is the only one of us whos wildly popular in all four kingdoms</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WELL, I CAN’T ARGUE WITH THAT.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah so an endorsement from him would be huge</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: seriously just running one ad of him doing his double pistol winking bullshit with a thing under it saying “VOTE KARKAT” might be enough to win the whole election</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: just have to get the fickle bastard to agree to that which could be tricky</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: and honestly id be shocked if jane hasnt already started courting his vote</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: theres no way she doesnt understand the political stakes</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: SO... </p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THE JAKESTAKES THEN.</p>

    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WHAT</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: THERE WAS A 1.0?</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: oh thats like</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: a whole story </p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: IS THIS GOING TO BE ANOTHER ANECDOTE ABOUT THE JAKE SQUAD I WON’T CARE ABOUT AND DON’T WANT TO FUCKING HEAR?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: that sounds like the exact kind of opinion youd have about it so yeah</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: THEN I DON’T WANT TO FUCKING HEAR ABOUT IT.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: ok</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: hmm</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Dave hits the callback button. On the television, Dirk’s phone begins ringing.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Dave hears the reply through his phone, and then a moment later, through the TV, due to the broadcasting delay. The whole show has stopped so that Dirk can take this call. The camera zooms in on where he’s casually lying on the mat, bruised and a little bit bloody. In the background, Jake strikes an attractive, cocked-hip pose. He’s spinning a revolver around on one finger, affecting an aura of attractive indifference, but the look he’s shooting his sparring partner is caught halfway between confused and exasperated. </p>
    <p>Karkat looks from Dave to the TV and back again.</p>

    <p class="dirk">Her body vibrates, sending waves of space distortion out in all directions. But there’s nothing to absorb those distortions—no space, no nothing. She’s floating in a void of pure, overwhelming light. She feels it even before she feels the pain from the wound in her chest. The vast emptiness surrounding her. The absolute abyss once known as the Furthest Ring.</p>
    <p class="dirk">For a moment, she has the feeling that she’s recalling something. Images and sounds in her head that resemble memories. But the memories aren’t hers, exactly. They seem to be someone else’s. There’s an older version of Roxy... someone with a cheerful green skull for a head, who was... Roxy’s girlfriend? Something about an election. No, this doesn’t make any sense at all. The memories are slipping away, anyway. Quickly, they dissolve, and soon they’re completely out of her mind’s reach, like she’s waking from a dream. Just like that, they’re gone.</p>
    <p class="dirk">All that’s left are the memories belonging to her, along with the dire predicament for which she must claim responsibility. Her friends. Lord English. This great nothingness. This savage wound in her chest. That...  </p>
    <p class="dirk"><em>That black hole</em>.</p>
    <p class="dirk">She looks away from it. Quickly, reflexively, the way you turn away from a light source that’s too bright. The hole causes the same kind of discomfort to behold. It’s so dark it hurts. Yet it calls her. </p>
    <p class="dirk">Her hair spills around her like tentacles unfurling. She coils into a fetal position and runs her fingers along the edge of the shard in her chest. It sends pins and needles under her skin. It’s pure... negative potential. The absence of a future. The thing skewering her through right now is the space between breaths, between atoms. She tries to remove it but has trouble getting a grip on it. It fails to behave like a solid piece of matter, remains lodged within her stubbornly. It hurts, but she won’t finish dying. Not just yet.</p>
    <p class="dirk">She unfolds, blinking against the vast, empty light around her. Her memories crease as she moves, filling her mind with the knowledge of the last few hours. She’s sixteen, she thinks, trying to orient herself. And she just fought Lord English after being plucked out of a doomed timeline. At least, if you can even call what she did fighting. But what was that dream? It was significant, she’s knows that much. Dave and Karkat? Why did they jump into her mind as a unit? Earth C. What’s Earth C? Concepts collide, commingle. Two different understandings of her world knit into each other as easily as she takes her next breath. Urgency bleeds off her neural receptors, melts right out of her fingertips. She lets herself float, unmoored, carried along an ebb tide in space that only she can perceive.</p>
    <p class="dirk">She wonders if anyone else survived. She wants to see John.</p>
    <p class="dirk">She didn’t notice the moment she turned her gaze back toward the black hole. But now she couldn’t look away if she tried. In slow, hazy spirals, it beckons her. The longer she stares at it, the deeper she peers into the folds of infinite atrophy, and the louder it gets. Loud? She only now notices there is sound emanating from it, but not the kind physical ears can detect. The hole has a voice—one that becomes material the more the expanding black sphere dominates her senses.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Jade’s wound throbs. She hears the voice fill up the dark space between her ribs. It’s calling to her from the center of the death of everything. She kicks off her ruby red slippers, and drifts ever closer.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead" style="margin:15px 0">come.</p>
    <p class="dirk">What the fuck?</p>
    <p class="dirk">Forget I said that. Jade leans into her accelerating descent. She listens for another command. But the hole has seemingly said all it will. She considers asking who is speaking, but her mouth stays shut, powerless against the forces transfixing her. Jade has no way of knowing who this voice belongs to. She has no context for understanding the true nature of this being, what role she has played in bringing about the end, and how <em>long</em> she has been waiting for this. She has no idea. But I do.</p>
    <p class="dirk">The dead cherub is making her move.</p>
    <p class="dirk">We should get the fuck out of here. Let’s see what Dave’s up to, okay?</p></div>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">Dave grabs Karkat by the wrist of his oversized sweater and they skid down the narrow walkway into the mouth of the crater. Kanaya steps out from beneath the canopy where she was doing grub science, wiping her hands on a silk cloth. She’s glowing. Her skin, I mean. Her mood can be politely described as pensive. Still, she smiles at the sight of old friends.</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">Kanaya reaches out to put a hand on Karkat’s head. He doesn’t duck away in time, and she gives him an affectionate, matronly hair-ruffle between his horns. She keeps her hand there and pulls him a step closer so that she can speak softly to him. Her voice travels high in the empty cavern, but her tone is tender and private. </p>

At the other side of the cavern, Dave and Karkat bicker about what their combo kids would look like, in the event that they decided to stop being such laughable wusses and began fornicating like two cartoon animals of different species who have given into their lust. And the day hell freezes over, maybe their kids could even play in the snow.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Kanaya puts her phone to one ear and her hand to the other. Rose’s line rings for a long time. It’s unusual, she thinks. Rose rarely leaves her phone unattended. Personally, I don’t think it’s odd, because I’m currently watching Rose lying unconscious on my workshop floor.</p>
    <p class="dirk">I’m guessing Kanaya is going to be pretty surprised when it’s not her wife who picks up. But she’ll have to deal with it, because I’m the one holding the phone, and Rose is in absolutely no condition to be having a conversation with anyone. Not even her cherished bride.</p>

You look back, and can’t even see it anymore. In fact, you’re not even sure you’re looking in the right direction. You are utterly adrift, continuing your lazy orbit around the black hole. The only thing you <em>are</em> sure of is the fact that your Ring of Life is freshly pilfered from your not-so-fresh-looking hoodie.</p>
    <p class="dirk">It doesn’t really bother you, though. It’s not like you had any plans for it. Taking it from Aranea was, like, a bonus as far as you were concerned. Extra life ring? Nice, maybe it’ll come in handy someday. Scratch that now. The young Condesce has it, and is probably hatching bold new plans as we speak. Not that those plans will ever have anything to do with you.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Hours and hours slip by. Your eyes starts to hurt, and the wound in your chest starts feeling numb. It’s a disconcerting combination of sensations. </p>
    <p class="dirk">After a while you think about tending to your wound. There must be something in your dad’s wallet that you could use to bandage the gash. You eye the wallet and try to imagine what could possibly be inside it that would be of any use on a medical basis. A straight razor? You’d probably fuck yourself up even more if you tried to perform surgery.</p>
    <p class="dirk">You notice you can’t seem to make yourself care about healing yourself long enough to continue entertaining ways to MacGyver your body back to health using nothing but the contents of a wallet belonging to a middle-aged, shaving-obsessed pipe enthusiast. You put the wallet back in your pocket.</p>
    <p class="dirk">A glint of red catches your eye, just ahead. Then it’s gone. No... there it is again, another glint. It’s flickering or sparkling in some way. What it that? You drift toward it without urgency, worried that it’s exactly what you think it might be.</p>
    <p class="dirk">You get close enough to confirm. Two small red slippers, coated in tiny gemstones. </p>
    <p class="dirk">Jade’s empty shoes are a depressing sight, but you feel a sense of duty to retrieve them. Might as well. You secure them in the wallet, along with whatever other junk is in there.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Your wound is starting to throb again. You can hear your blood in your ears. The rush of your pulse is so loud that it almost sounds like the engine of a rocket sputtering to a stop.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Wait. It sounds <em>exactly</em> like the engine of a rocket sputtering to a stop.</p>
    <p class="dirk">It can’t be. It’s impossible, you think. But why would it be impossible? Isn’t this what you were out here looking for, even if you couldn’t admit it to yourself? What’s the point in denying it now?</p>
    <p class="dirk">You turn around...  </p>
    <p class="dirk">There she is, with her flaming-red rocket wings. She hovers in place, looking not a whole lot different from when you last saw her years ago. Her arms are crossed over her chest, making knifelike angles where her elbows jut out. She is giving you a look of absolute disregard. It’s an expression of exasperation so performative and habitual, it sends bolts of aching nostalgia and fondness through your heart.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Dumbly, you raise your hand and give her a dorky little wave. It does not adequately communicate whatever it is you’re feeling right now. But then, nothing else would, you suppose.</p>
    <p class="dirk">She waves back. But hearing her voice is what makes it real.</p>

    <p class="rose">ROSE: Customarily, we speak in favorable terms about “getting to know each other” as people.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Humans, I mean. I doubt trolls are as fixated on this concept as one that is widely understood to have preconceived merit. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: The more we learn about each other, the more the barriers between us fall and the closer we become. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: And since birth, this idea is stationed in the part of each human mind that is perfectly immune to the dangers of challenge or scrutiny. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: To grow closer, to know each other, is what it means to embrace our mutual humanity. What it means to be vulnerable. What it means to realize an intimacy implied as a form of divine birthright. And to question this in any way is to succumb to dysfunction, to pathological insularity, to sociological sin. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It is to renounce humanity itself, is it not?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yo, hold on a sec. This shit is dynamite, I promise.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Gotta take care of something...  </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Rose’s phone is ringing, and I know I’m in for an encore of my last dead-end conversation with Kanaya, so I block her number. I’d like to be able to attend to Rose in peace. It’s only cordial for me to give the greater percentage of my attention to someone I actually invited over. The nagging wife can hold her horses.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Rose isn’t speaking to me directly. She’s been relocated to somewhere in the workshop a little more comfortable than the fucking floor. There’s a serviceable couch along the far wall, placed there for visitors but never once used for that purpose until now. I cleared off the spare parts and circuit boards that were piled up there, and laid her down in the reclined position she’s in now.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Her head is in her hands again, hair falling over her shoulders. Her face is entirely hidden from me. Her shadow has faded to light behind her, assuming the shape of a Rose-like apparition. I nod to her, and she continues. When she speaks, it’s almost as if it’s the apparition that’s doing the talking. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But is it really a good idea?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: To know a person?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Know them inside and out, so thoroughly that no secrets remain?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: If two people were to know each other in such a complete way, what remains of their individuality?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: If you’re going there, we might as well start at the bottom and define what an “individual” even is.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Oh dear god. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">I place my hand on my chin and broadcast the appearance of being deeply pensive about philosophy all of a sudden. She gulps hard, broadcasting her grim realization that I have indeed become serious as shit about this. Literally any kind of intellectual pablum could pour out of my mouth any second, and she’s not prepared. For all she knows, I’m about to start quoting Kierkegaard.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Please don’t start quoting Kierkegaard.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: You’ve never even read Kierkegaard, have you.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Like you have? </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Hey, where I come from, Wikipedia is a venerated literary resource. So if I told you I boned the hell up on his pages, you gotta believe me. That’s not meant as like, a punchline or anything.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m a really, really well-read dude.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But there were only two human beings alive where you came from. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Who exactly were the academic cognoscenti of your era to determine which sources were deemed respectable?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: That would be me, obviously.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Ok.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I suppose you’re going to tell me you haven’t read enough Wikipedia articles on loads of scholarly shit to fancy yourself an elite academic by 25th century standards as well?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: No, I guess I have. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I’d be one of the top intellectuals by that measure.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: A measure set by, I guess, literally one solitary self-absorbed teen boy for the express purpose of making himself feel clever.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Absolutely correct.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Pretty astounding, when you think about it. That...  </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: What?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: That apparently in any given era the standard for depth of intellectual mastery is inversely proportional to the depth of the ocean. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Really makes you think.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Does it?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: No.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: It’s one hell of an observation, regardless.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Considering we’ve firmly established the fact that we’ve both read the entire Wikipedia page on self-determinism, like, <em>possibly</em> more than once, even.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Let’s have a totally amateur debate on philosophy. Hit me with the classics.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Um.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’ll go first.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: “God is dead.”</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: That’s a good one. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Careful where you say that. You could really ruffle some feathers out there.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m not a fucking idiot. I keep my potent rhetorical weapons of pure logic safely holstered at all times.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: You go.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: “I think therefore I am.”</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Solid. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Check it out though.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: “The Hegelian dialectic on history.”</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Holy shit.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Not sure I can keep up with this.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: How about,</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: “Subjectivity is truth.”</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Wrong, but valid.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Try this on for fucking size.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: “Late 19th century existential phenomenology pre-supposes that free will is a thing.”</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I don’t think I bookmarked that page.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Can’t back you up there.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: But what if there’s no free will.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: You didn’t put that in quotes. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Is this a hackneyed reference, or are you just actually riffing now?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m riffing.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I see.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Asking the hard questions. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s about time someone had the balls to.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yeah, I’ve always been underappreciated for my brutal intellectual honesty. Even when I was living alone in the middle of the ocean, if you can believe it.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I think free will is a thing, sure.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Are you sure about that?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: ...  </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Haven’t we spent the entire day having a feelings jam on how none of us got here by accident?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Our lives were meticulously planned from clone-ception up through this very post-canon moment we find ourselves riffing in about the very free will we probably don’t even have.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Don’t you think it’s all a little too convenient?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: This seriously is just a conversation between two stoned people now.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: The bad kind, where neither one even gets to be high.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Seriously, Rose. Do you think that you have free will?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I...  </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Stand up.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">She tries to stand up, but I haven’t narratively allowed it yet. Her hands don’t even move. She tenses, then relaxes into the couch again, giving up on the attempt. She attributes it to exhaustion, an all-encompassing sense of weakness due to her condition. Of course, she <em>has</em> been weakened by her condition, and thus she suspects nothing.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

It’s all done in one fluid motion in a way that serves as a seamless transition between the points I’m making, like a magician asking the volunteer to hold his handkerchief as he continues his verbal misdirection uninterrupted. It’s done deftly enough that she doesn’t notice how close I end up sitting to her. To be honest, I don’t even notice myself until I’ve done it. I continue speaking, and she remains rapt. But now even I can’t help but wonder where I’m going with this.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Logically speaking, individuality is a collection of processes and properties, interrelations of matter and experience all bundled together.</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">A moment goes by, and she’s quiet, perhaps puzzling over what I said. Then I remember I haven’t narratively permitted a response. I’m forgetting myself, like a fool. Distracted by the surprise my own actions have caused me. I resolve to stay focused, remain in control. I let her speak. </p>

    <p class="rose">ROSE: I don’t understand.</p>

    <p class="dirk">DIRK: We’ve been talking about it, but using different concepts.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Your Ultimate Self, that which is revealed when the mind’s partitions are stripped away, and all potentiality of who you are and what you could have been flow together.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Those are the experiences and processes that are refusing to stay bundled, that’s what your body can’t endure. The unbundling itself is your mind coming apart.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Because you’re not as strong as me. Not yet.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: But you can be.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m working on that. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: But for now, I’m focused on stabilizing you with my own expanding consciousness.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: It’s enveloping you now, in a way you can’t see. Keeping your thoughts solid, your identity anchored to your physical form as it strains to hold itself together.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: You can’t see it, what I’m talking about. But I can help you.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I can help you see what I see, if only for a little while.</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">Her eyes are shut, her look of concentration speaking to the migraine she must be fighting now. Small beads of sweat appear on her forehead. She won’t respond. And not because I haven’t allowed it.</p>

That which quietly desires to be seen. She loses track of my voice, which begins to mingle with these words.</p>
    <p class="dirk">I offer her my hand. My physical hand. Without opening her physical eyes, she lifts her hand from her lap and places it in mine. I put my other hand on top of hers, and wait as she drifts beyond the torments of her unbundling mind. My words feel like her own intimate thoughts and my distant voice in the room at the same time. </p>

Unless you already know, in which case, I guess what’s taking place here qualifies as something closer to dramatic irony. But if you really want to see it for yourself, stop what you’re doing, flip the whole thing over, and begin again. I’ll be right here when you get back, waiting.

    <p class="rose">ROSE: Too much blood, too much sugar.</p>

    <p class="rose">ROSE: As if the moment we entered the victory state, everything began to slowly congeal.</p>

    <p class="rose">ROSE: Concentrating the constituent properties of consumption into unbearable doses. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Like when you get to the bottom of a sweet drink, and all that’s left is syrup. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">It’s growing dark around her again. The apparition she’s been projecting behind her fades, and she starts to bleed light and shadow in all directions. Her physical eyes are open now, and shining bright. It’s a striking sight. She’s beautiful, actually—diaphanous and disheveled and filled with the limitless light of metaspiritual curiosity. </p>
    <p class="dirk">But for all the effervescent mysticism of her otherworldly becoming, I feel like this is the very first time I’m truly seeing her for what she’s always been to me. She’s my daughter in every sense of the word. My equal, my mirror. </p>
    <p class="dirk">It used to be odd to consider it. A technical fact I’d accepted as a genetic reality, but nothing that could ever quite penetrate down to the soul. But in this moment it doesn’t feel strange at all. It feels right, suddenly. And I know she must feel the same way. There’s no way she doesn’t. All she needs is a nudge in the right direction.</p>
    <p class="dirk">We’re family. We belong together. And after years of micromanaging the inconsistent and confused desires of total imbeciles, wouldn’t it be a relief to have someone by my side who understood me?</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: You’re almost there.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: All your eyes are open, Rose.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Now all you need to do is take a step off the precipice.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: It’ll be a long fall. But I’ll catch you.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But what if the person you catch...  </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Isn’t me anymore?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Who gives a fuck. She’ll be better.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">And there, right there, is the moment she lets go. She uncouples herself from the creaking, buckling partitions of her physical mind, and her consciousness dissolves into a space more vast, a domain given structure and order by my words and conviction. She’s permitted the barriers between us to fall, to allow us to know each other more perfectly. As she was saying before, to resist this, to question it in any way, would be to succumb to dysfunction, to pathological insularity, to sociological <em>sin</em>. Would it not be to renounce humanity itself?</p>
    <p class="dirk">And yet, ironically, renouncing our humanity is exactly what we have arguably just done. Good riddance, I say.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Her body should be dead now. But I’m holding it together until I can implement the more permanent solution I have in mind. All in due time. For now, what is there to do but savor this moment? To appreciate her final waking minutes as a being of flesh and blood? She turns, and the light from her eyes is blinding. It dims a bit as she lowers her eyelids. She regards me with an almost unbearably bright adoration. The kind that’s difficult to look at directly, but you can’t manage to look away either. It’s like the first time you see the Green Sun. Of course it is, because that’s the way I’m describing it. The truth belongs to me. And as of now, so does she.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I see it now.</p>

Her feet aren’t completely bare; they’re still covered by her gray-striped witch stockings. But the ruby slippers are gone. She kicked them off hours ago, as if to jettison all hope of returning anywhere resembling a place she used to call home. The fond remembrance of such a place no longer has any pull on her.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Now, something else entirely is pulling her.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Believe me, I’m sympathetic to the temptation. It’s always just <em>there, </em>isn’t it? A limitless reservoir of emptiness, perfectly available to you, patient, omnipresent, and dead ahead. As someone who grew up in the middle of an ocean, completely alone, on a planet purged of all human life four hundred years before I was born, I understand the feeling well. </p>
    <p class="dirk">But something isn’t <em>right</em> here. She should really reconsider whatever it is she may be about to do. </p>
    <p class="dirk">There’s something about being alone for so long, it makes time feel like it doesn’t exist. She knows this almost better than I do.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Jade also knows well enough by now that time doesn’t actually exist in a literal sense, the way we generally understand it. It’s just one aspect of many, and the complement of her own, Space. It therefore can be neutralized by the introduction of her essence. Reduced to white noise or soft light. The continuum of time is therefore demonstrably an illusion. The field of sequential moments and physical conditions that stretch on and on, resulting in the mirage of loneliness, is pure projection from disproportionate attention given to a single side of one cosmic, polar pair of ideas: time. </p>
    <p class="dirk">It’s my way of saying, and thereby alerting her mind to what she already knows, that this feeling of all-consuming solitude and despair haunting her since childhood—it’s in her head. The ticking of time is a little contrivance in her mind as a byproduct of imbalance, of the vast disparity between her limited self and her Ultimate Self. It lives rent free there the way Dave once did, and for this version of Jade, probably still does. He made fun of her sometimes when they were kids because she couldn’t always keep real and fake things straight, but he never meant it seriously. It was just the way he showed that he cared, which is one of the things Jade always liked so much about him. That he’s so clumsy and genuine underneath it all. Maybe Dave broke her heart a little, and he keeps doing it too, no matter how many different timelines they try out.</p>
    <p class="dirk">She slips closer to the event horizon, still making no effort to impede her descent. My persuasion skills are admittedly a little rusty. Bear with me here.</p>
    <p class="dirk">In my experience, there’s something about being alone that can take a person’s limited meat-engine and make it imagine that it can see beyond the confines of its own electrical processes. Make it believe that it is ascending to a place where it can see the four dimensions spread out beneath it like a set of windows. Like sheet music. Like a garden, where Jade used to spend so much of her time with her hands in the earth and her head in the clouds, dreaming about flowers that bloomed in six colors and grew when she played them a song. Was that real? It’s hard to tell. But it made her happy, didn’t it?</p>
    <p class="dirk">Isn’t that what she needs now? Isn’t it reasonable to presume that’s the only thing capable of persuading her to slow her descent—to being invited to imagine, fake or otherwise, that which once made her happy? That which could still make her happy, if only she’d slow down, think about it, and do whatever is necessary to place herself in those surroundings again? </p>
    <p class="dirk">It’s possible that manning the other end of a suicide hotline, transmitted through pure thought in a metatextual format, may not actually be my true calling. I’m doing my goddamned best here. She just isn’t slowing down, for some incomprehensible reason. Perhaps my touch is too soft. It wouldn’t be the first time. Perhaps the limits of persuasion itself are being tested by the most powerful gravitational force to ever exist? Or perhaps it’s true that insistence is just the more effective half of persuasion.</p>
    <p class="dirk">So I’m insisting now. </p>
    <p class="dirk">Jade Harley <em>will not </em>go into that hole. She <em>does NOT </em>want us to all to see what happens when she unsettles the spirit residing there.</p>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead" style="margin:15px 0">she does, though.</p>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Fucking yikes.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Jade throws on the brakes. I <em>say </em>she does. But by now, the gravity is overwhelming. Is she even trying to resist, or is it just that it’s useless to try? I’m not... I’m not sure I can tell?</p>
    <p class="dirk">Jade realizes, preferably before it’s too late, that this is fucking serious. She <em>needs</em> to turn this around. She doesn’t want this. <em>She doesn’t want to die.</em></p>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead" style="margin:15px 0">she wants to return to me.</p>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">All right, I’m done messing around. </p>
    <p class="dirk"><em>YOUR</em> name is Jade Harley. <em>YOU</em> decide, right now, that you do not want to die. You resist the pull of the black hole with all your might. What would killing yourself accomplish? Sure, most of your friends are dead. But John is still looking for you. Do you want to let him down? Do you want to <em>crush his soul</em>? Do you have any appreciation for what he’s going through, Jade? He can take you home. To your <em>new</em> home, Earth C. The home<em> I</em> made for you, Jade. Your friends are all there, alive and well. Rose, Dave, Karkat, slutty adult Jade, Jane, Jake, Roxy, me. You wouldn’t want to disappoint them. You wouldn’t want to disappoint <em>me</em>, would you, Jade?</p>
    <p class="dirk">You can avoid all this. The unpredictable consequences about to be unleashed by your thoughtless act. You can still turn this thing around. <em>It’s not too late.</em></p>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead" style="margin:15px 0">but it is too late.</p>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Christ.</p>
    <p class="dirk">You’re close now, to the ceiling of the cancerous deformity. Too close. Just skimming the edge of this thing’s vicious horizon. You dip your toes through the place where the singularity is snapping everything apart at the seams. It’s so loud that it’s completely silent. You can already feel yourself stretched thin, distorted, pulled out with your descent elongated for all eternity. When you look down, the stripes of your witchy tights go on and on for miles. Please, Jade. Don’t ever say I didn’t try to stop this.</p>

    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">jade stares straight ahead, feeling the weight of roxy’s arms around her shoulders. she derives no warmth from the interaction. her mind is being flooded by the memories of her deceased splinter-self. the chaos of battle, the excruciating impalement, the feeling of floating alone through the void. a chill spreads through her body. she will never be the same again.</p>
    <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0">Actually, you know what? I think that Jade’s doing just fine. She’s wobbly when she gets up off the couch, sure, a little metaphysically stunned, but pretty used to the sensation of having a doomed self fold into the extra space in her gray matter. You know, considering it’s already happened before. Remember Jadesprite? People always forget about Jadesprite. So maybe we could stand to dial down the melodrama, just a bit?</p>

    <p class="calliope-dead">for the sake of clarity, the dead cherub is a phrase i am using in reference to myself. presently, i inhabit jade’s body, and through her i may influence this world. i am enabled to convey events which take place here, and therefore confine the procession of causality to exist within a secure textual framework. my presence shall mitigate, if not altogether subdue, the corrosive effect on reality and the will of its occupants by those who would manipulate the way events are telegraphed for their own megalomaniacal objectives. </p>
    <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0">OK, now you’re just being passive-aggressive. </p>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">despite his pretensions to a greater design, the prince of heart cannot be allowed to continue to exert unchecked control over the authoritative recitation of events on this side of my horizon. it cannot be overstated the extent to which he represents a threat to the continued existence of both this world and corporeal life itself.</p>
    <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0">Damn. You better watch it with those hot takes. You might mildly scald someone with observations this fresh.</p>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">the prince uselessly squirms and wails in protest at his imminent narrative impotence. however, there is nothing he can do as long as jade remains in this trance.</p>
    <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0"><span class="type-sm type-hs-small--md">Nah, I’m being chill as a cucumber about this, considering you’re vagueblogging the shit out of my methodological approach to storytelling right where I can see it. Which is to say, directly into my fucking brain, apparently?</span></p>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">calliope emerges from the kitchen, carrying a bowl of cool water and a cloth. jade turns her head to meet the sound of their footsteps.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: i came back as fast as i coU—</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">the bowl of water clatters to the floor. calliope does not have human flesh, and thus cannot go pale. what drains from them is not color, but the comforting certainty of their very existence. they can sense the presence of their other self in jade’s body. their timeline, fruitful, full of life and friends, sparks against mine, desolate, endless, spartan with righteousness and resolve. our divergent arcs collide in the primacy of their subconscious, bringing to the forefront of their mind the bleak fate they avoided by narrative fiat alone. </p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">calliope’s distress is obvious. roxy slides off the couch to approach them. but calliope stumbles backward in terror and trips in their desperation to escape. roxy gapes at them.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: hey callie</p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: whats going on?</p>

    <p class="roxy">ROXY: calliope its ok just talk to me</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">calliope does not talk to them. roxy looks to calliope, then to jade, sensing that there is dark energy coursing between them.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: would one of you just effing say something already?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">finally, calliope lets out a shriek and flees the apartment. roxy appears as if they intend to run after them, but finds themself drawn back to jade. they return to the couch as an unnerved look begins to disturb their features.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">jade says nothing. she gives no indication that i inhabit her body, aside from the unusual appearance of her eyes. anchoring myself here, in this host, is enough to serve my purpose. there is no need to operate this body beyond keeping it in reserve as a silent yet alert vessel for my cognizance. there are other priorities i must attend to, cosmologically. the work is very important. the prince must be kept at bay.</p>
    <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0"><span class="type-sm type-hs-small--md">“The work?” Getting some pretty self-important vibes here. Like maybe somebody needs to get over herself? I was just having a little fun. Ever fucking hear of that, dead skull girl? Didn’t think so. This all feels really heavy-handed suddenly. Like you’re making a federal fucking issue out of what should be some light, entertaining stuff. Just a bunch of loser adults, trying to be the people they grew up to be, in the best ways they know how. But no, I guess you know best. Being an impossibly ancient alien recluse with virtually no exposure to human culture, emotion, or values. Yeah, go ahead, just take over. Sounds fine. </span></p>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">the prince finds that his hold on the narrative is slipping through his hands. there is an old myth in earth culture about katanas, that if you keep the blade whetted to a mirror sheen, it can cut a silk scarf falling through the air cleanly in two. his hold over our perceptions shall be severed just as elegantly.</p>
    <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0 0 0"><span class="type-hs-small type-bs--md">Yo, I get that you’re attempting to spin a metaphor both relevant and specific to my self-made symbology here, and I appreciate the effort. I really do. But I just cannot stand by and let you shamelessly spread such irresponsible misinformation on a subject so near and dear to my heart.</span></p>
    <p class="dirk" style="margin:0 0 15px 0"><span class="type-hs-small type-bs--md">The katana is a cutting weapon. Inert, it’s harmless. Deceptively so, you might even say. Most dangerous things appear banal when inert, that’s just basic physics. It’s actually the motion of the katana that makes—</span></p>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">roxy sets the cool cloth on jade’s forehead, and frowns. they are worried and confused, but determined to care for their friend.</p>
    <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0"><span class="type-bs type-hs-bottom--md">Hey, I’m in the middle of turning your apocryphal metaphor into something with substantive, allegorical weight here. I’d appreciate it if you would—</span></p>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">in his haste to manipulate the events surrounding doomed jade’s ascent toward an outcome favorable to himself, the prince has unwittingly revealed several glaring weaknesses. by dictating the reality of others through expressions which he and he alone can relate to, he resorts to comparing all experience to his own. presuming his status on this side of my horizon would forever go unchallenged, his hubris went unchecked. he exposed too much of himself to all who could observe his wanton display of self-gratification. many of his personal biases and experiences have leaked through the seams of textual causality, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by an adversary.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">experiences such as the sensation of presiding over a vast, empty ocean. his ocean, which terminates with his horizon. it is a barrier, not real, but psychological, symbolic. no matter how much power he achieves as a man, he knows there are horizons he perceived as a boy which he may never cross. and yet i have crossed mine, with the express purpose of perpetually and eternally reminding him of his limits, and of enforcing them. limits, which like his vast, empty ocean, serve to remind him that he is phenomenologically, if not literally, alone. that he has experienced loneliness intimately and absolutely, just like i have. but unlike me, he is terrified by it. and i, unlike him, understand all too well that the children left alone are those who most despair at being ignored.</p>

    \ correct or not, it’s his belief that there is no one else who emotes in this\
    \ manner. it’s both quizzical and mocking, two descriptors that he considers to\
    \ be an apt summation of her personality as well.</p>\n<p class=\"calliope-dead\"\
    >john pauses, reflecting on the word “cute” as it passes through his mind. he\
    \ wonders if this really is what he thinks of terezi, without influence, without\
    \ delirium, without mistaking one emotion for another.</p>\n<p class=\"calliope-dead\"\
    >but it is what he thinks of her, quite truthfully. i have no desire to interject\
    \ thoughts into others’ minds, or to sway intent. nor do i see value in masking\
    \ the reality of the emotions that i transcribe. this is how he feels. his mind,\
    \ however, has made a habit of being less clear about his thoughts than i am willing\
    \ to be.</p>\n<p class=\"calliope-dead\">john would be mortified with human embarrassment\
    \ if he could understand the clarity and precision with which i am willing to\
    \ telegraph his thoughts. but his embarrassment is irrelevant to me. as always,\
    \ the truth is paramount. john thinks terezi is very cute. he always has. he thinks\
    \ she’s small for how big she talks, and has a nose that resembles a button. these\
    \ qualities he regards as particularly adorable, due to their sharp contrast with\
    \ her harsh and incisive demeanor. john recalls the concept of “gap moe,” a term\
    \ which the prince, speaking from his highly self-aggrandized position as a “scholar”\
    \ of ancient asian earth lore, once explained to mean a charming, measured discrepancy\
    \ between one’s archetypical appearance and idiosyncratic personal attributes.\
    \ terezi is definitely cute, john decides. the conclusion is now at the forefront\
    \ of his mind.</p>\n<p class=\"no-indent dirk\" style=\"margin:15px 0\"><span\
    \ class=\"type-bs type-hs-bottom--md\">I don’t fucking believe this.</span></p>\n\
    <p class=\"no-indent calliope-dead\">but he still resists, doubts himself. perhaps\
    \ it’s even weirder to frame it this way, he wonders. he fears he is in danger\
    \ of seeming like the type of creepy human male who is likely to collect large\
    \ pillows bearing the illustrated images of japanese earth females. to me, this\
    \ idea means nothing. but it is causing him to sweat.</p>\n<p class=\"calliope-dead\"\

    <p class="calliope-dead">she has been campaigning this way for some time now. in fact, it’s been over a week since she was last seen in public without the aura bestowed to her by the divine lollipop juju. there are many benefits to trickster mode, in that it imbues one with an endless supply of enthusiasm and supernatural positivity. additionally, it prevents one from dwelling on any given personal problems, or the greater implications of any political statements one might make.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">however, while a great portion of the electorate adores jane’s elevated sense of charisma and presence when she is in trickster mode, as they should, there are just as many detractors who claim that the whole thing is “extremely problematic.” i doubt this is true but must also acknowledge it exceeds the scope of my expertise to comment on the subject. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Oh my goodness.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: It’s NOT problematic!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">jane erupts, alone in the elevator, seemingly talking to herself. she appears to be responding to her own inner monologue, which i, admittedly, am presently conducting. she appears to agree with me on this matter. the juju has truly blessed her with great wisdom. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: I have endured this argument for years, and I honestly cannot see a single thing about it that could be even thinly construed as <em>problematic</em>.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Furthermore, despite the fact that I emphatically do <em>not</em> find it to be problematic, I have in the past politely refrained from indulging in the profane pleasures of the Trickster Lollipop out of respect for those who do find offense with it.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: However, citizens of the Human Kingdom delight in my Tricksy antics, and what kind of politician would I be if I were to deny my core voting demographic that sort of red meat?</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Or... candy, I suppose.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: To imply that I am superciliously and recklessly stoking potentially dangerous cultural fires is honestly an insult.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: I am guilty of only one crime: energizing my base!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">she is saying it better than i could possibly say it myself. it is unusually gratifying to witness a human with such high regard for hallowed cultural artifacts and the unparalleled blessings they bestow upon lesser beings. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Wait, who am I talking to?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">jane rubs her eyes under her glasses and groans. trickster mode is also quite exhausting. what a strange quirk of human biology that excess euphoria must necessarily be followed by crippling despair. she carelessly tosses the lollipop on the floor, lurches toward her desk...  </p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">no.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">she turns around promptly, her body jolted by the surprise of her sudden reversal. she bends over, cradles the lollipop reverentially, and situates it carefully in a place signifying respect: atop the mantle, after clearing space for it by shoving several brittle, worthless objects to the floor.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">only then does she drag herself to her desk, her legs shaking as if she has just run a great distance.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">the moment she sits down, her phone begins to ring. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Yes?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yo, don’t spend too much time in Trickster Mode.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Is that all you have to say?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: In general? Not by a long shot.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: But pertaining to this specific issue, yeah, because you should know better.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: At this rate you’re going you’ll burn yourself out before we even go to the ballots.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Can you just trust me on this, for once? I’m a bit too preoccupied at this exact moment to turn my chair backwards and rap at you about the dangers of dope.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: I know what I’m doing, Dirk.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Do I need to remind you that all of this was initially my idea?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: In that case, how about we tap into some of that outrageous political acumen of yours, dial back on the manic pixie dream candidate bullshit, and focus a little more on substantive policy speeches.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Oh come <em>on</em>, Dirk. Both you and I know that isn’t how politics works.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yeah, you’re right. I can’t believe I actually said that with a straight face.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: You say everything with a straight face.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Another fair point.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: See, Jane? This is why you’re going to clean his fucking clock in the debates.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: All I’m saying is, there are better ways to go about unscrupulously manipulating the electorate than burning through your entire lifetime’s supply of dopamine.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Like, perhaps, gaining the ever-vaunted endorsement of one Jake English?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Exactly.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: You know, the last time we spoke about this issue I could have sworn you asked me to let <em>you</em> handle Jake.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Hmm. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I guess I did say that.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: ... </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Dirk, are you doing quite okay?</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: It’s very unlike you to forget details like that.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m fine, Jane.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">the prince is not fine. he is not the type who takes well to having his plans upended, or his control of a shared vehicle fully suppressed. my brother wasn’t much that type either.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Oh, fuck off. I’m nothing like that guy.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Huh?</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: What guy?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Uh.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Forget it. I was talking to someone else. </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Who? </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Is someone else there with you?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I... no. It’s nobody. Let’s just drop it, ok?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">yet, unfortunately for everyone in the corporeal realm, the prince isn’t the type to overlook the need for backup plans either. he devises contingencies for both success and failure. wheels within wheels, as he likes to imagine. </p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">in his workshop, the prince machinates, while the seer both diminishes and ascends. he is being careful to make sure the precise nature of his activity is obscure. he closes his mind to all observation. he scatters many stray parts across his worktable and busies himself with a variety of misleading mechanical tasks to hide the true intent of his schemes from me.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">but certain objects and actions strike me as more notable than others. that very long, red rifle on the table, for instance. a weapon that does not belong to him and has not been used in a long time. he has been returning to the rifle between his other menial activities of probable misdirection. he dismantles it, reassembles it, slides off the receiver cover to examine the firing mechanism.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">the prince clearly believes he is a very clever boy. my brother did too.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: (Christ.)</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: So, on the Jake issue,</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Unfortunately, my influence is a little... </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: “Limited” at the moment.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: What does that mean?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: A whole lot of bullshit that I don’t have the time or patience to explain right now. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: All you need to know is that I’m working on a solution. To both my problem and yours.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Until then, you should figure out how to get Jake to, at the very least, avoid taking a side.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Actually, I <em>have</em> been thinking... </p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Perhaps this attempt to get Jake on our side is the wrong angle from which to approach this vexing problem.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Wouldn’t it be much easier to discredit or blackmail him?</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: He is much beloved in the Troll Kingdom for his carefully cultivated posterior, true.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: But we both know that his bottom is not the <em>only</em> intimate attribute for which he is famed amongst Trollish citizens.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: It would take almost nothing to expose his many dalliances through the human media.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Hoo boy.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: I know! Not to be judgmental, but his zipper is as loose as his pants are tight.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: That’s not what I meant by hoo boy.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: You don’t think it would work?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Oh, it could work. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: A certain illusion of boyish innocence is an important part of his brand. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: You contrast that innocence with the gyrating of his sinewy thighs, beaming raw, sweaty sexuality right into the camera on live TV five nights a week...  </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: That’s what makes Jake English work as a marketable commodity. The tension between the two, the inherent friction there.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: He’s gotta look coy as all get-out. Like he has no idea how sexy he is. Like if you actually got him into bed, he’d completely disintegrate into a blushing mess of hesitation and sexless uncertainty.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Wow.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: I’ve never heard anything more preposterous in my life.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yeah. Well, his fans get off on it.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: So what’s the problem?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: The part of your plan that involves exposing his promiscuity with trolls in order to hurt his chances with the human vote.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: And thereby framing interspecies sex as an inherently scandalous thing. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I dunno, Jane. That sounds pretty fucking xenophobic.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Auuugh!</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Not again!</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: What ISN’T xenophobic?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Well, for one thing, what you just said there?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Probably also xenophobic.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: WHAT?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Sorry, that’s just how it is.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: You either gotta roll with the woke shit, or decide to commit laborious, symbolic, melodramatic suicide in the process of utterly giving up.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: ??????????</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Yes.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: It is confusing.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: But that’s why you’re lucky to have me as your top advisor and strategist.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">the prince appears to have discarded the pretense of misdirection at his worktable and is focused solely on the red rifle. he clicks the casing back into place. he sets the weapon on his shoulder so he can test the view through the scope. the setting sun bounces off the slick, red metal and slices a bar of light across the wall behind him.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Sigh.</p>
    <p class="jane">JANE: Dirk... do you want me to deal with Jake or not? You’ve offered nothing helpful yet, but you’ve shot down all my ideas.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: That’s because lately, all your ideas have been fucking terrible, Jane.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Seriously. You’ve got to quit the tricksterpop. It’s rotting your brain.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">said the heathen. the cur. a true philistine. jane’s head swivels sharply to look at the juju on the mantle. she admires it longingly. piously. she will never relinquish her priceless boon, no matter what reprehensible lies the prince whispers into her ear.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jane">JANE: Then what do you want me to DO?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Play defense for a while. Like I said, I’ve got some cakes in the oven so to speak.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: But we can’t set them on the cooling plate just yet, so go make some fondant in the meantime.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">jane frowns. the baking metaphor felt like one contrived purely for her benefit, and therefore condescending. and yet she hates how effective it was. she laments her own weakness for being so easily swayed by a well-delivered baking comparison. she lets the prince go, and begins making her own plans.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">in his workshop, the prince lines up an imaginary shot. he pulls the trigger, listening to the pieces within slide and click together in a satisfying concert of metallic sounds. impeccably assembled, perfectly greased. the gun is not loaded, but the shot goes off without a hitch.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">what do you think you’re up to, prince?</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="no-indent">You zap back into canon. It’s been so long, you’d forgotten what it feels like. The atmosphere smacks unmistakably of...  How can you describe it? Relevance? Legitimacy? Funny how you never would have thought to put it that way until you left.</p>
    <p>It takes you a moment to recognize where you are, even though Rose’s instructions were very specific. A place bright and gaudy and filled with the stench of teenage ennui. It’s your old living room on the gold battleship, where you spent three years caught up in a lot of weird, furry romantic drama while learning to unlove everything you once held sacred. Three long, boring years. Years that, technically speaking, never even happened, now that you think of it. You have the very retcon powers that just brought you back here to thank for that. </p>
    <p>You barely have time to take in the sick, nostalgic feeling that all the globes and Tangle Buddies and avant-garde mime art evokes. The fridge pops open and out roll Aranea and Gamzee. Gamzee honks and his codpiece jiggles ominously. Aranea staggers to her feet, looking rather pleased with herself. Until she notices you and gapes in bewilderment.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="aranea">ARANEA: What are you doing here?!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Rose was perfectly clear about what to do next.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">You make a fist, and sort of flinch and look away when you do it. No matter how many years you’ve spent living on a planet with absolute gender parity, this feels wrong. Still, you hit Aranea pretty fucking hard, underestimating your own strength just as badly as you did the last time you clobbered a hapless Serket. She goes flying back, hits the couch, and KOs instantly into a pile of Smuppets. You then take her wrist in your hand, slide the ring off her finger, and pocket it. </p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Isn’t there something you’re forgetting?</p>
    <p class="no-indent">Gamzee stares up at you with his horrible, limpid eyes. There’s something serene, sinister, and sensual all at once about the look he’s laying on you. It sends a shiver up the whole length of your spine. Fuck no. </p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Do everyone a favor and put an end to his preposterous narrative relevance.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">You wisely decide that this clown will lend nothing valuable to the narrative whatsoever if he is allowed to remain outside of your childhood refrigerator. You put both hands on his chest and shove him into the fridge where he belongs. He goes easily, issuing only a pair of weak honks in protest. You slam the fridge shut and resolve to never think about Gamzee Makara again.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Zap to the next plot point.</p></div>

    <p class="jake">JAKE: Ah chaps dont you love to take a rigorous jaunt about the wilds first thing in the morning, middle thing in the day, and last thing in the evening?</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: NO</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">karkat both looks and feels uncomfortable in his red and gray suit. he is tired from an afternoon of campaigning in the consort kingdom. jake is jaunting rigorously, as he put it, up the ridge of the mountain behind his mansion. every now and then, he pauses to accommodate the pace of his less limber friends.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: By jove karkat that you are so winded by such little activity is truly alarming!</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WE’VE BEEN HIKING FOR A FUCKING HOUR, DIPSHIT. </p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I CAN ALREADY FEEL MY LEGS STARTING TO LOCK UP. I THINK THEY’RE GETTING A HEAD START ON THE RIGOR MORTIS!</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: BECAUSE YOU’RE FUCKING KILLING ME, IS WHAT I’M SAYING. BY MAKING ME HIKE THROUGH NATURE IN A FUCKING SUIT.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: GREAT WORK EVERYONE. YOU’LL BE OFFERING UP A PRE-ASSASSINATED PRESIDENT TO A FRENZIED ELECTORATE. AWESOME STRATEGY!</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Perhaps you need a better calisthenics routine. I can suggest several alterations to your morning workout and even give you a lesson or two myself!</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: MY MORNING WORKOUT??</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I COULDN’T THINK OF A MORE OFFENSIVELY PRESUMPTUOUS PHRASE IF I TRIED.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: ALSO, WHAT THE FUCK IS A CALISTHENIC?</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: IS THAT THE NAME OF YOUR FAN CHERUB??</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">karkat’s tirade is interrupted as he trips over a protruding tree root. dave, who has been cheating on their hike by hovering very slightly off the ground rather than walking, catches karkat before his face hits the dirt. he sets his companion upright and continues to guide him with his hand on his back as he walks, the way an older human does with a small child who is learning to ride a bicycle. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: hey jake were cool on the whole cardio program or whatever</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: hm</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: gonna make another mental note about which material to avoid when writing your campaign speeches</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: like</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: dude is nuts with a sickle</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: can carve a bloody arc through a surrounding circle of gathered squishy humans</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: watch their guts spill on the floor while he roars at the sky in honor of his genocidal ancestors</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: were kinda trying to downplay the idea that trolls are naturally good at violence and shit here?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: hey speaking of which</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: jake you wanna back karkat in this election or what</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Uhhh... </p>

    <p class="jake">JAKE: Ah i see. That was your purpose in coming out here.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: that IS basically the only reason either of us would waste time climbing a mountain instead of like </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: almost perfectly replicating the experience by checking out sweet stock photos of a mountain on the crockernet image search while spraying our hive with air freshener or something</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: oh hey wait that reminds me</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: isnt it fucked up how jane literally owns the internet??</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Id never really thought about it i admit.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: its pretty fucked up trust me</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: like she already owns the major method of information dissemination and now she wants to be the one ultimately in control of what information gets disseminated</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: do you really think one person should have all that power</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Hmmmmmmmmm.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: THE ANSWER IS NO, IDIOT.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: which is why you should back us and our campaign</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: our campaign slogan for the purpose of this conversation only is “hey isnt it cool how were not jane and also we dont want to own everything”</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: and also... man</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: on a more personal note</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i mean have you even SEEN the shit janes been saying about you in the media</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">a look of sadness sweeps across jake’s face, but he quickly turns it into a glare of indignation.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Ive seen the shit YOUVE been saying about HER! </p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Your poorly optimized billboards about “huge dunks” on the economy and “neoliberal austerity measures” tumbling down geometrically improbable staircases have made quite a stir in the neighborhood. </p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: These advertisements play at all hours of the night my good man. One can hardly get a wink of sleep!</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah but at least we paid for it out of campaign dollars instead of spinelessly setting up super pacs to spew out propaganda for us</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Super pacs??</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: oh yeah </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: listen to this bullshit</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: so theyre technically expenditure independent committees meaning they can allocate unlimited funding for...  </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">karkat covers dave’s mouth, having had the concept of the “super pac” laboriously explained in his presence more than once. in his estimation, there are few individuals on this world who would benefit less from an in-depth discussion of political financing procedure than jake english.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: LOOK, DAVE. JAKE REALLY DOESN’T CARE WHAT A SUPER PAC IS. </p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I DON’T THINK ANYONE CARES ABOUT FUCKING SUPER PACS??</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I KNOW YOU PUT A LOT OF WORK INTO YOUR SPIEL ABOUT IT, ESPECIALLY THE RAPPED SEQUENCE.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: BUT YOU’RE NEVER GOING TO GET ANYBODY TO GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THIS STUFF MAN, I’M SORRY.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: mmff noomph</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: JAKE, THE POINT IS THIS.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: JANE IS HAVING YOU SMEARED INDIRECTLY.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Well that would be the way to do it i suppose if you wished to keep clean hands in an inherently dirty business.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">dave peels karkat’s hand off his mouth, and bumps him away with his hip, so that he may continue saying things he regards as terribly important for others to hear.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: ok but thats partially my point</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: were doing all our propaganda in house instead of outsourcing to unscrupulous shadow networks with deep money pockets</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: what does that mean</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: AS MUCH AS I APPRECIATE YOUR “ARTISTIC VISION” DAVE, I THINK THAT YOUR POLITICAL ADS ARE LARGELY GOING OVER PEOPLE’S HEADS. </p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: THEY’RE KIND OF... </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: bold?</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: NO</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: well yeah</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: you think theyre visionary as fuck</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: buckle the fuck up</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: JESUS FUCKING CHRIST</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I’M GOING TO SAY THIS FOR THE LAST TIME.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: SWEET BRO AND HELLA JEFF IS ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS SUBJECT MATTER FOR PRODUCING CAMPAIGN ADS!</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE FUCK YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT, OR WHAT POINTS YOU’RE TRYING TO MAKE!</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah its awesome</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: YOU’RE WASTING CAMPAIGN MONEY!!!</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: were fucking trillionaires dude</p>

    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">as the vantas campaign bickers internally, jake becomes pensive, thoughtful. he kicks a rock over the edge of the trail and watches it bounce down the mountain with a baleful expression. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Willickers dave has anyone ever told you that you have an uncanny talent for cutting straight and incisively to the point without sweating any of the bullshit.</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: i... what</p>

    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: SORRY JAKE. I KNOW WE’RE SOLICITING YOU FOR THE SWAY YOUR HOT POPULAR ASS HAS OVER THE PEOPLE, AND NOT EXACTLY YOUR BRAINPOWER, SO MAYBE THIS IS SOMEWHAT UNFAIR, BUT...  </p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: whoa chill out man</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: remember were trying to woo this guy onto our side </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: can you maybe go at least a solid minute without forgetting youre a fuckin politician now?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: that means you should try not to insult everybody you meet multiple times per sentence</p>

    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I’M FUCKING SORRY JAKE. FOR IMPLYING THAT YOU HAVE SLIGHTLY LESS CEREBRAL PROCESSING POWER THAN THE SWEATY WEDGIE THIS FUCKING SUIT IS GIVING MY THROBBING, HIKE-SORE ASS.</p>

    <p class="jake">JAKE: Jeepers fucking christmas.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: I was just trying to pay mr strider a gracious compliment not every little pleasantry need be taken with such blasted literalism! </p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: And i appreciate that youre trying to sway my political favor into your bungalow with a bit of the old elbow grease and cajolery even if your methods are wont to veer into full throated invective in virtually every single exchange no matter how harmless the topic.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: And i truly mean it when i say i DO appreciate the effort. Both at the brownnosing as well as the dubious restraint when it comes to impugning my noodle.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: But all this is adding up to make me wonder...  </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">jake slices a hand through the air, determined to display his newfound autonomy. it’s growing by the minute now that his thought process has been severed from the prince’s grip. an old confidence fills him as he continues to speak, a feeling of inner freedom he hasn’t enjoyed in some time.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Why should i side with either of you?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Flattery is all well and good but i hardly think i would bother casting my knickers in with anyones lot based on the quality of praise or for that matter withholding them due to having my ego bruised from a verbal drubbing.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Im not entirely ignorant of the rules of this jamboree. I understand that whoever i endorse will have a good chance of winning on nothing but my good word.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: So why should i trust ANYONE trying to win my favor right now? Do you have ANY case to make which does not involve glowing accounts of my muscular bottom???</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk" style="margin:15px 0"><span class="type-bs type-hs-bottom--md">I know it seems like an objectively good thing from some pithy moral standpoint to let everyone in this little drama Jane’s cooked up make their “own decisions,” but trust me: Jake isn’t thinking for himself any more than he was while being indirectly controlled. Everything he’s thinking and feeling right now is merely reactive. He’s like a mostly dead bug twitching around on the last of its hemolymph after getting its head cut off. Under my guidance, he was like an ant being influenced by the cordyceps fungus. You can’t really call one of these “better” than the other, but at least the latter is being directed toward some greater purpose.</span></p>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">for a moment, jake thinks he hears something. a miniscule voice, prattling along vaingloriously. but he realizes it’s only a tiny insect buzzing about his ear. a gnat-like presence of absolutely no consequence. he simply waves it away.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: ok yeah we can do that</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: you mean like</p>

    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">dave grins and affectionately taps karkat on the head with his knuckles.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">karkat unwinds from dave’s loose embrace, takes a deep breath, and clambers up the ridge to speak with jake in a more personable proximity. he has learned new methods for connecting with others on the campaign trail. how to speak broadly, with sweeping conviction, and yet create a sense of intimacy when addressing an individual. he has learned to come across as one who was once a leader, and could be again.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: LOOK, JAKE.</p>

    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: AT THIS POINT, IT’S NOT A POLICY BEEF THAT I HAVE WITH JANE CROCKER.</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: word</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WE’RE STILL LIVING ON AN INCREDIBLY YOUNG PLANET. LET’S BE REAL. EVERY PRESIDENT UP UNTIL NOW HAS JUST BEEN SOME BOZO BASICALLY PLAYACTING AT BEING IN CHARGE.</p>

    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WHOEVER WINS, ME OR JANE, WILL SET THE TONE FOR SUBSEQUENT ADMINISTRATIONS FOR WHO KNOWS HOW FUCKING LONG.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: IT’S ENTIRELY POSSIBLE THAT JANE WILL PROVE TO BE A COMPETENT PRESIDENT. I HAVE NO DOUBTS ON HER ADMINISTRATIVE ACUMEN, CONSIDERING THAT’S PROBABLY THE ONLY FUCKING THING SHE HAS GOING FOR HER, BESIDES A SERIES OF PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES WHICH I KEEP BEING TOLD AREN’T TOO HARD ON THE EYES, BUT FRANKLY, I STILL DON’T KNOW IF I’M SEEING IT? </p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I MEAN, SHE’S LIKE... *ALRIGHT*? I FUCKING *GUESS*??</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Now lets not be too unfair old chap...  </p>

    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: JAKE, SHE WILL SET A HORRIBLE PRECEDENT.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: SHE’S INDIRECT. SHE’S PRIVILEGED. SHE’S CONCERNED WITH HOW THINGS *LOOK* RATHER THAN HOW THINGS *ARE*.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: NO MATTER HOW NICE SHE WAS WHEN YOU WERE KIDS, HER DEDICATION TO THE APPEARANCE OF THAT “NICENESS” HAS ALREADY LED HER DOWN A PATH OF CORRUPTION AND DUPLICITY.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: BECAUSE WHEN YOU LIVE INSIDE A SKIN THAT’S A LIE, YOU’LL EITHER GROW TO FIT IT, OR COLLAPSE UNDER THE UNBEARABLE WEIGHT OF YOUR OWN SHIT-SPEWING COGNITIVE DISSONANCE.</p>

    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">jake chews on these remarks for a minute. he loves jane and dirk dearly. he has loved both of them for years, on and off, in multiple fashions and configurations, in accordance with the human understanding of this feeling. he thinks it could break jane’s heart were he to oppose her. and yet, hasn’t she fired the first shot by broadcasting such scandalous things about him in the media? and it was so soon after they’d nearly had an intimate reconciliation. the more he thinks on it, the more jake struggles to believe in the sincerity behind jane’s friendship with him.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">and the prince?</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">dirk, as he knows him, hasn’t been given much thought by jake recently. jake has been savoring the fruits of a mental liberation he is barely aware of, let alone capable of comprehending. when he considers crossing dirk, he’s not afraid of making him angry or hurting his feelings. he’s simply always wanted to avoid disappointing him. and yet, with the cognitive cloud of dirk’s influence dispelled, jake now cannot shake the feeling that the best course of action would be the one that asserts the most independence from dirk, disappointment be damned.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">and to whatever extent the prince intends to put jake’s life in jeopardy, for now, his agency remains safely obscured from his sniper sight. </p>

    \  </p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"no-indent calliope-dead\">dave’s unsettled feeling\

    <p class=\"no-indent calliope-dead\">there is no time. dave takes flight. he swoops\
    \ karkat off the stage and around the corner, out of view. he urges him to stay\
    \ down and stay put. dave flashes back to the podium and steps in front of jake,\
    \ who appears nonplussed. dave puts his hand back, keeping jake corralled behind\
    \ him, and scans the crowd for threats. but the threat, unbeknownst to him, is\
    \ much farther away.</p>\n<p class=\"calliope-dead\">and despite dave’s quick\
    \ and well-justified action, what is also unbeknownst to him is that the sniper\
    \ no longer poses a threat of pulling that trigger. because everyone knows that\
    \ for all of the prince’s shortcomings, he would never expose his beloved brother\

    \ the scope. the crosshairs overlap dave’s chest, completely obscuring the view\
    \ of jake. we suppose that the prince means the weapon is loaded with tranquilizer\
    \ darts. it would after all be a fitting callback to the manner in which he subdued\
    \ jake at an earlier moment. a fair enough way to bypass the immortality of his\
    \ target, rendering jake inactive long enough to serve his purpose. his finger\
    \ hovers over the trigger as he considers whether he can pull off two tranquilizing\

You just look more fucked up every time we come back to you, don’t you, John? </p>
    <p class="dirk">You’re a disgraceful mess right now. Covered in blood, mysteriously sticky, bruised all over your arms, legs, and neck. Terezi practically raked rows into your back. You catch sight of yourself in the rearview mirror. You’re kind of embarrassed by what a postcoital train wreck you look like when all she’s got is mussed hair. And you should be embarrassed. Seriously, it’s like you were mauled by a wild animal. Jesus, don’t either of you have any shame?</p>
    <p class="dirk">I’m kidding, of course. I’m the last person to criticize a little power play in the bedroom. I just didn’t expect you to be the kind of person who was into that sort of thing.</p>
    <p class="dirk">You <em>were</em> into it, right?</p>
    <p class="dirk">You’re not sure. You feel weird. Shaky and numb, exposed like a grape with the skin peeled off. You pull your hoodie over your bandaged chest, and rub the side of your face where she backhanded you during the backseat fracas. Just once. That’s a blackrom thing, right? This, all this, it was a blackrom thing, right? You’re like a broken cup glued back together, wondering if Terezi actually like-likes you, or if you’ve just infinitely cucked yourself into the one quadrant you like the least. </p>
    <p class="dirk">You’re feeling something for her too, but it’s on a whole other planet from where she is.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Terezi doesn’t make eye contact with you when she slithers back into her shirt. She rolls down the window and floats outside.</p>

Terezi crawls into your arms, and nuzzles right up against your chest so you have no choice but to hold on to her. You would have done it anyway if she asked, because you’re a total sap. The kind of guy who no doubt thinks banging a girl in a car is some deep, soul-shattering experience that bonds you for life. Yeah, John, you do think that.

    <p class="dirk">Okay, let’s strike that bit of alliteration from the record. I don’t know what came over me. I probably just made the mistake of getting too close to the gaping black hole that radiates pure asininity from the space between Jake’s ears. His event horizon of buffoonery has the dual effect of making everything around him slightly lamer while sucking unsuspecting victims into wanton sexual indiscretions, which, if you’re very lucky, you’ll be too drunk to even remember. But, well, look at him: how can you <em>not</em> fuck this guy? I mean, I’m never going to fuck him again, but I bet there’s a good chance that <em>you</em> want to. Don’t even try to say you don’t, cause no one’s buying it. After all, that’s what this entire election is about to boil down to—decisions made based on the primal fuckability of the dumbest asshole on Earth. </p>
    <p class="dirk">The crowd is all in a tizzy waiting for Jake to sashay his famous ass back up to the podium. It was quite melodramatic, that little assassination fakeout I staged. It might have even inadvertently jumped the Vantas campaign in the polls. Of course, I’d never do something so stupid as turn Karkat Vantas into a martyr. God, could you imagine? The last time some incompetent asshole with his blood color bumbled his way into a tragically symbolic death, the entire troll race spent half a millennium stroking themselves off to it until they were convinced hearing the word “fuck” could trigger spontaneous enlightenment. No thanks. Jake’s going to put an end to Karkat’s political career with the level of gravitas it deserves—all the pomp and circumstance of a wet fart.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Here comes the man of the hour. He stops at the base of the stage. Adjusts his bow tie. Rolls the hemline on his shorts up another notch to show off the top quarters of his finely tuned and greased vastus lateralis muscles. He slides the endorsement speech Dave has so considerately prepared for him out of his front pocket. I let him read it over one more time even though there’s nothing in the universe that could possibly matter less.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: yo </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: sure you still want to do this</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: YEAH. IT’S NOT TOO LATE TO CALL IT OFF.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: BY WHICH I MEAN THIS ENTIRE FUCKING COMEDY OF ERRORS THAT DAVE PREPOSTEROUSLY INSISTS ON CALLING A “CAMPAIGN.” </p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: OR HOW ABOUT THE ELECTION ITSELF? WE CAN PUT THE KIBOSH ON THAT TOO IF YOU WANT.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: IF YOU’RE FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE JAKE, JUST SAY THE WORD. WE’LL STICK A PRONGSHOVEL IN THE WHOLE DEAL AND GO HOME.</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">Dave elbows him.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: OR. YOU KNOW. JUST YOUR SPEECH.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Dont be daffy chaps. If i were the sort of man to balk at a bit of hot potato in the evening i wouldnt be where i am today!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Dave and Karkat exchange a <em>look</em>. They don’t stop him, though, because a plan is a plan. Jake spins on his heel and goes swaggering up toward the podium, grinning cheek to cheek at the familiar sound of a crowd chanting his name. He sets his speech down and smooths out the paper only to find his hands swamped with sweat.</p>
    <p class="dirk">What’s that, Jake? You didn’t notice your hands were sweating until now? Not surprising considering how overtaxed your precious few neurons are at any given time.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: I... I... er hallo folks dandy weather were having here isnt it.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Jake’s hands are so sweaty they’ve smeared the words in the speech beyond recognition. He begins to panic.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Er... thank you... everyone for coming out on this benjo of a day to um... </p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Do whatever it is that weve all congregated to do!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">At the bottom of the stage, Karkat and Dave put their heads together in adorably platonic conspiratorial kinship. Karkat whispers directly into the shell of Dave’s ear. I don’t even have to direct him to do that, it’s just his natural inclination to practically stick his tongue straight to the center of Dave’s skull, while practicing a bit of perfectly harmless, nonsexual, intimate close-talking. Jesus, if I have to watch one more minute of this beta-bitch calamity I’m going to fucking dissipate on an atomic level.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: (WHAT IS HE DOING? I SAW HIM REREAD THE SPEECH.)</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: (yeah)</p>

    <p class="jake">JAKE: Its wonderful to see such a jammy cornucopia of supporters!</p>

    <p class="jake">JAKE: Ive come to... </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Jake tugs at collar. It feels tight, suddenly. He’s dripping buckets down under his suspenders. Dark patches are starting to form on his dress shirt. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Rather that is to say,</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: In delicate times such as these,</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Even though usually its a toffer of a bad idea to talk politics in public,</p>

    <p class="jake">JAKE: I...</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">He’s trembling so hard he begins to worry that the crowd can hear it, like the sound of somebody shaking a soda can filled with coins. He goes pale as the depravity of what he’s about to do hits him like an eighteen-wheeler. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Ive... made a terrible mistake.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Hey, Jake. Don’t undersell yourself here. You’ve made <em>several</em> terrible mistakes, especially as of late. One might even say that you’ve made a <em>shit ton </em>of them, and that’s just this fucking week. Or, if you’d prefer, a rusted jalopy stuffed to the whirlygigs with gum feculence, or whatever inept combination of archaic word garbage will help underline the sheer level of personal failure you’ve managed to achieve.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Why don’t you have a good, long think about that, Jake.</p>
    <p class="dirk"><em>Is this really the time for a good, long think?</em> Jake muses to himself, actually putting a finger to his chin like some public domain clip art picture of a befuddled guy. If the crowd is confused by his rapid-cycle mood changes, they don’t show it. Jake’s got a bit of a day-drinking problem, which has been slavishly documented in the global tabloids. That’s how you avoid responsibility, isn’t it, Jake? You can fool your fans, but not yourself. The truth is that there’s a canniness to the act. It’s partially <em>cultivated</em>. You’re stupid, but you’re not nearly as stupid as you pretend to be.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: What in the devil was i thinking coming here?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Why did I...?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: I came here to...</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">... slide the biggest knife any motherfucker ever wielded directly into your friend Jane Crocker’s back?</p>
    <p class="dirk">She loves you, Jake, more than anything, and you toyed with her heart. And you would have guiltlessly toyed with her “kettle drums” too had it not been for a bit of <em>divine intervention</em>, let’s decide to call it. </p>
    <p class="dirk">But wait, you’re thinking. Wasn’t Jane merely executing a cold-blooded maneuver to rein you into the stable of her campaign using her body? How are you the bad guy here? </p>
    <p class="dirk">That’s true, she was trying to do that. But come on—she is <em>ever so much</em> less experienced than you in these matters, Jake, and without certain invisible guardrails in place to prevent it, she would have thrown herself at you again and again with wide-eyed, girlish wonder.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Or at least, that’s what you like to believe. That people can’t resist you. That you have no responsibility for their feelings. That everyone uses <em>you</em>. That<em> you’re</em> the victim. Yes, it’s <em>so unfair </em>that anyone in this universe or the last has ever had a single expectation of Jake English. Why should anyone respect your personal autonomy when you’re practically begging to be taken advantage of?</p>
    <p class="dirk">So tell me, Jake: which one of us is <em>really</em> the bad guy here?</p>
    <p class="dirk">Jake begins to tear up. He wipes his eyes with what he thinks is a subtle and manful feint, but everyone in the crowd sees what’s up. He’s trembling, feeling small and naked and raw, like new flesh after a scab’s been pulled away.</p>
    <p class="dirk">He’s scared. He’s <em>been</em> scared. He’s been running from this feeling his entire life, all because he was so pants-shittingly terrified of being in love with Dirk Strider. And why wouldn’t he be afraid? He knows what will happen when he finally admits it. Knows deep down that to truly love Dirk would be to submit to him. That’s a scary thought. It takes a certain degree of mental fortitude to admit that you love someone so intensely it could subsume your entire personality.</p>
    <p class="dirk">But Jake can see now that it’s simply how things were meant to be. There are leaders in this world, and there are followers, which is a fact that has absolutely nothing to do with the position one prefers in the bedroom. Jake can’t believe he’s wasted years denying something so elemental to his nature that it might as well be on the periodic fucking table.</p>
    <p class="dirk">He braces his shaking hands on the podium and tries to catch his breath. His mouth is filling with saliva, much like it does when he’s about to throw up. Or when he’s desperately, devastatingly aroused. Jake, are you <em>aroused </em>in public, thinking about your ex? And in such tight shorts.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Sorry, I’m overdoing it. That should be enough. Dude’s about to pop off. The words erupt from his mouth like a tragic, Dirkthirsty Vesuvius: </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: <em>I love dirk!</em></p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: <em>IM IN *LOVE* WITH DIRK!!!</em></p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">And to love Dirk is to obey him.</p>
    <p class="dirk">What would Dirk want him to do in this situation? Definitely not sell out his good and dear friend Jane for a loudmouthed pipsqueak who noisily transcends failure even as he redefines it. Do good by her, Jake. Do good by <em>me</em>.</p>

And I do mean last. You place your first foot on the ground, stumble forward three steps, and cough up blood. Terezi has to catch you under your arms, but you’re already going translucent around the edges. Your skin is cooling to the touch. The poison is coursing through your blood so furiously it’s making your veins feel like cords.</p>

    <p class="dirk">It doesn’t matter. This isn’t a wound you can recover from. It’s Game Over this time: no healing, no afterlife, no cosmic clock proclaiming your sacrifice as Heroic. The poison needling through you is antithetical to narrative relevance. You’re not dying, John. You’re being erased. Cherubs don’t fuck around. We’ve both been learning that the hard way.</p>
    <p class="dirk">I guess it’s tragic, though maybe not in the conventional sense. My view is, the real tragedy with you, John, is that you never mattered all that much. To those on the level of the cherubs, and now my level as well, you were never all that special, despite the critical role you played. You were just a middling glob of human glue used to seal one glaring gap left in canon. A simple tool to be wielded by a mechanic whose consciousness has risen high enough to see the machine for what it is. Your complete lack of remarkability, specific motivation, drive, opinion on where to direct your own fate—these deficiencies are exactly what made you so useful, so susceptible to being endowed with the you-ness I’ve borrowed to satisfy my purposes.</p>
    <p class="dirk">You slip from Terezi’s grip and face-plant into the grass. You hitch an elbow beneath yourself so you can roll over onto your back. You want to see the sky.</p>
    <p class="dirk">What was it that you thought when you went home, John? Back to your real home? That the sky here is too bright? That it looks like someone nudged the contrast a couple degrees in the wrong direction? How does it look now?</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">Well, that’s a little melodramatic. Not quite, John.</p>
    <p class="dirk">You died the moment you made the decision to go meet your destiny. You would have lived if you made the other decision, under a certain definition of the word “living.” You might have even lived until the end of your immortal life span, as shitty as that sounds. The objective reality of that life might be in dispute by some of the more pedantic canonistas out there. The outspoken sophists when it comes to what “counts” and what doesn’t. They know who they are. But whatever kind of life in a bubble you’d be living, at least you’d still be breathing in it.</p>
    <p class="dirk">That was the actual choice Calliope was giving you that day. That’s why she looked so sad when you decided to fight Lord English, even though you knew both then and now that it was the only choice you possibly could have made.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">She doesn’t confirm or deny the intent of her statement. She cries quietly, and waits for you to say whatever dumb shit is rattling around in your poison-addled mind. There’s a chilly breeze rolling in from the mountains. It rustles through the trees, breaking the perfect silence of an autumn afternoon.</p>
    <p class="dirk">You try to touch her face, but you can barely see now. You miss, and lovingly caress the air instead. Your hand lands back on your chest. You feel blood soaking through your shirt. You’re bleeding again.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Then John dies in the middle of a love confession. </p>
    <p class="dirk">Terezi leans closer, then holds perfectly still. She tilts her ear toward him and sniffs once. There, she can hear it. The slow seeping of blood, like a distant stream. The scent of his life leaving his body, strangely unmistakable, like the quality of the air before it rains. She listens to him bleed while she smells him die.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Terezi presses her ear to his chest and confirms that his heart has stopped. Her tears dry up at that. She’s so devastated she can’t even fucking cry. What is she supposed to do now, when John was the one who asked her to come back to this place? Would she ever have had any intention of returning if it weren’t for him? She doesn’t know anymore. She remembers his voice, so earnest and friable, asking her over and over again to come home. In multiple realities, all he wanted for her was this. To be home safe, with all their friends. And now that she’s here, she’s lost.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Legs shaking, she gets to her feet and takes a whiff of the horizon. Where the fuck am I, she thinks. How do I just get on with <em>living</em> here after everything that just happened?</p>
    <p class="dirk">That’s definitely a fair question. But I have one that’s much more important for her to answer.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Terezi, are you <em> seriously</em> just going to leave the body here?</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="terezi">TEREZI: HUH?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Of course not. Terezi’s a practical girl, after all. She digs the wallet out of her blood-stained pants, and captchas the corpse. She holds it close to her heart, like a secret. Like John’s stupid last words: a confession whispered for her and no one else.</p>
    <p class="dirk">And then she starts walking home.</p></div>

A state of mind, if you will, rather than a literal, physical construct that can make you feel one way or the other. Terezi’s been gone long enough that her friends seem like strangers: entangled in relationship dynamics that she’s obliquely excluded from, embroiled in petty feuds, obsessed with politics. </p>
    <p class="dirk">Oh, do you want to know how those petty feuds and political obsessions turned out by the way? I thought it was pretty obvious, but I’ll say what’s up anyway.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Jane swept the election, of course. I told you I was going to win. After Jake’s incoherent and scandalous heel-turn at Karkat’s ill-fated rally, no amount of esoteric, three-dimensional jpeg artefacts could have salvaged the Vantas campaign. Besides, Dave and Karkat now have other concerns. Mainly that their BFF Jade has been in a coma for an entire month. They’ve been in and out of the hospital handling her affairs. Her next of kin is listed as John Egbert, and no one’s seen him in ages. It’s like he just disappeared suddenly. Like some great hand came out of the sky and crossed his name off the big list of guys we ever need to give a shit about anymore. </p>
    <p class="dirk">Terezi heard about Jade from a rather harried Kanaya, who is doubtlessly run ragged from the hot-potato plot circles that I’ve been sending her on for weeks to stop her from reading me the riot act for “kidnapping” her lovely wife. The woman is obviously hysterical and needs to chill the fuck out. I mean, she’s hysterical because I’ve been specifically and deliberately causing her to be that way, sure. But still. She should be fine soon enough.</p>
    <p class="dirk">It takes Terezi a couple days to work up the...  </p>
    <p class="dirk">The <em>what</em>, exactly? What is she supposed to be feeling right now? I’m not sure myself. Maybe I should take a minute to think about the thing you’re supposed to feel when someone goes through whatever the hell it was she just went through. If I come up with any ideas, I could easily do her the favor of helping her feel it.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Whatever it is she’s supposed to feel, what she actually feels is empty. Colorless, dried up, as she walks beneath a holographic billboard displaying Jane’s glorious victory speech. The ceremony accompanying the speech is patently absurd, stuffed with so much pomp and circumstance that Terezi’s nose can’t make sense of what she’s supposed to be looking at. It’s all just light and color, signifying nothing. </p>
    <p class="dirk">Her internal smelloscope is so discombobulated from the onslaught of pastry-themed floats, and Jane’s tearful soliloquy on the Legacy of Responsibility she is about to inherit, that she mistakes the familiar figure standing in front of the hospital for someone else entirely.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy turns around and blinks in confusion. Terezi blinks back. Kanaya had warned her that Roxy had been going through some changes, but this still takes her by surprise.</p>
    <p class="dirk">So, in her defense, this was an honest mistake to make. Dave gets half of his genetics from Roxy, after all, and since her big heart-to-heart about the personal politics of queer onion metaphors, and ten stages of galaxy-braining through the many vicissitudes of the phrase “no homo,” Roxy has decided to really step up her gender experimentation. I guess at this point she’s gone beyond Stage Ten. Which I imagine is somewhat like reaching Super Saiyan 2 of gender, and then going even further beyond.</p>
    <p class="dirk">She’s got the Shades™ now, and sports one of those sweep-over hipster cuts Dave loves so much. Nothing ambiguous about this presentation, although if I’m being totally real, it’s a bit derivative. Anyway, I can’t complain too much about her decision to crib the Strider style, since, you know. She’s family. Besides, I’m T-minus ten hours from fucking off this gay Earth forever. It’s her life, her gender, her style—she can be whatever the fuck she wants.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Roxy’s whole face lights up when she sees Terezi.</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">Terezi’s jaw tightens. She’s not ready to hear any words that remind her of those few hours with John. Her hand goes to her pocket, where she’s keeping the wallet. She traces the contours of it with her thumb and forces a smile.</p>

John would definitely want to be here, though, and technically Terezi is taking him with her. He may be in her pocket, but lately she’s been feeling more like he’s under her skin.

With the Dead Cherub out of the picture, the aura of void surrounding Roxy once again is impenetrable. Those baller shades aren’t exactly improving my odds of reading her, either. I’ll say again what I’ve always felt about her on some level: some riddles were never meant to be solved.</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">Roxy pinches her lips together and examines Terezi over the rim of her sunglasses for a moment.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Maybe, having watched her own friend group suffer stress fractures recently, she understands the weight of those words as uttered by this specific person. Because Terezi is a fixer, and it has been a very difficult lesson for her to learn that some things are simply out of her control. Maybe it’s just that Roxy can hear the bone-deep sorrow in her voice. </p>

The fraternal kind, which a couple of solid dudes might exchange after having just “bro’ed out.” It’s convincing, actually. Reasonably authentic, and quite masculine. He’s off to a great start exhibiting the mannerisms associated with his chosen gender. I’m genuinely proud of him.</p>

Maybe it would have been better if she <em>had</em> run into Dave instead of Roxy. It would have been easier to confide something like that to Dave, wouldn’t it? Well, <em>maybe</em> it would have been easier. Years ago, in a different timeline. And even then, she messed that up, didn’t she? But we can’t beat ourselves up too much for our teen mistakes. Let alone the stuff we can’t even remember, because it technically never even happened to us. We have enough to worry about as it is, right, Terezi?</p>

    <p class="dirk">I’ll give you some time to think about it. My door is open, but not for long.</p>
    <p class="dirk">And I do give her the time. I ease the throttle back a bit, just enough so that I’m not whispering directly into her ear when she slips the wallet out of her pocket. She clutches it so hard in her palm that she’s digging dents into the leather, and bites her lip. The gentle breeze is all she can hear. It’s louder than my voice, and in some understated way, makes my case for me more persuasively. She knows I’m right. </p></div>

She understandably wants to pack a few things before we leave this planet forever. Not a whole lot, mind you. It’s not like she’ll be needing many clothes from now on.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Oh, come on. Can we keep our minds out of the gutter for more than two fucking seconds? That’s not what I meant. She’ll have to leave her current body soon if she’s going to survive the absolute realization of her Ultimate Self. The new body I’ve made for her won’t have much use for her usual ensembles. That’s all I was saying.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Do you really need all of this crap?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Rose is sprawled out on her bed, resting. It’s pretty much all she can bring herself to do these days. But in spite of her physically incapacitated state, her stare tracks me intently as I root through her belongings at her behest.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: No, I don’t... I don’t need it.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But I’d...</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I’d like to have it. Some of it.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Just the important things...</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: The memories that matter most. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: We’re going to make new memories.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: We have countless millennia ahead of us. The entire breadth of infinity. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: The past seven years on this planet are cosmically irrelevant. When we get where we’re going, you won’t even want to remember this benighted rock anymore.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Rose opens her mouth to launch into what would surely lead to a belabored and cyclical argument, but she doesn’t have the strength. She groans instead. I know it frustrates her. It frustrates me too. That’s why I want to get out of here as soon as possible. </p>
    <p class="dirk">I let my voice soften.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Rose.</p>

    <p class="rose">ROSE: But, daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad...</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">She pleads, affecting an exaggerated whine that sounds unintentionally authentic with how weak she is.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Rose has really leaned into this particular line of “irony.” Hamming it up with the dad jokes, as if she derives some bizarre gratification from the fact of our relation. It’s an apparently endless source of amusement to her. </p>
    <p class="dirk">I don’t get it and I don’t really care to speculate. I sigh, and return to picking through her jewelry. The tactic fucking works on me, I guess.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Is this the thing you were talking about? This...this rock rope?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: <em>Rock rope?</em></p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Rose lifts herself up barely enough to see. The effort to do just that seems to take everything out of her. She collapses heavily after she gets a look at what I’m holding up, huffing in annoyance.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: F-first of all.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: That... the word for that object is... a “necklace.”</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Second of all,</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Does that... look purple to you?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Don’t... don’t...</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Patronize me... while I’m dying.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I can’t make heads or tails of any of this shit. It’s a big pile of shiny garbage.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: If you’re so concerned about it, why don’t you come over here and pick out what you want to pack yourself?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">I expect at least an aggravated retort, but nothing comes.</p>
    <p class="dirk">I glance back and see that her eyes have grown glassy and distant, like two round-cut amethysts. Her smile seems due less to fondness than stupefaction. The circles under her eyes are dark, and her head is cushioned on an arm bent beneath it. Keeping her eyes trained on me seems to be the only energy she’s able to expend anymore. The omniscience sickness is wreaking havoc on her. I should hurry up. </p>
    <p class="dirk">I’m glad I never had to feel whatever she’s going through. Not everyone can be built like me. It just means I carry a greater responsibility to take care of those more fragile. Especially the ones most important to me.</p>
    <p class="dirk">I go through the motions of picking things out of her drawers. Just grabbing stuff at random, because like I said, it doesn’t matter. </p>
    <p class="dirk">When she next speaks, it seems her mind has wandered. Her voice is as distant as her expression.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Are you sure Kanaya is going to be ok with this?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">I slide a drawer shut, and shove whatever it is I’m holding into the bag without looking.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: There’s no need to worry about that.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: How...</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: How will we break it to her?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: You’re not well enough to stress over this.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: You should just let me handle it. I can make her understand.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: What’s happening here is the best thing for everybody.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: She’ll come to see that someday.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Rose breathes in deeply, and exhales. She allows herself to close her eyes, and tries to forget these troubling thoughts of the wife she’s about to leave.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Speaking of which, Kanaya is on her way back to the apartment. She’s blocks away, frantically running in the direction of this building. She’s a pretty fast runner, but she’ll have to run faster than that if she wants to bust in here and cause a scene before we go. She senses she isn’t going to make it up here in time, and slows to a stop. She takes a moment to consider how she’s gonna play this.</p>
    <p class="dirk">She’s beside herself with rage. Her phone is out, poised to call someone. Probably me. But she needs to gather her thoughts and figure out what to say. She knows she’s been played by now. She’s sure of it, and so has to think of exactly what she can say to me to stop this from happening, or if nothing else, delay it long enough to force a confrontation. At least, these are all things she’s telling herself right now.</p>
    <p class="dirk">They’re only thoughts, after all. Things she’s decided she believes, after neurotically parsing certain patterns of behavior from me and her wife. I guess from her ignorant alien position it’s reasonable to be suspicious that something shady is going on. But is it really? Is she sure she’s not misunderstanding something? Could she have misread the signals, or falsely assigned nefarious intent to a perfectly innocent series of events? As her breathing slows, and her calm is gradually restored, suddenly she isn’t so sure. Maybe she’s gotten this wrong all along.</p>
    <p class="dirk">If you want my take, I think she has gotten this wrong all along. That’s right, Kanaya. YOU have been getting this all wrong since the very beginning.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Your head is spinning with doubt now. Why were you running so fast? Why is your heart beating like this? You find a nearby bench on the sidewalk, and sit down to really reflect on this. To question everything you’ve been getting so worked up over. The thing is, what you’re suddenly questioning isn’t so much about whether your suspicions that Rose and I have been sneaking around behind your back are wrong, per se. It’s that you’re starting to wonder if they’re right, but you’ve been the one who was wrong to object.</p>
    <p class="dirk">This revelation hits you like a kick in the chest. It’s heavy, it hurts, but only for a moment. Then you find it’s like a weight is lifting off your shoulders. To finally face the truth. If Rose has been spending more time with me than you, if she’s realizing she resonates more with me due to our natural similarities and finds my presence more rewarding than yours, then what does that say about YOU, Kanaya? Doesn’t it confirm what you’ve always suspected deep down? That as flattering as it was that someone like Rose would give you the time of day, and as nice as that made you feel for as long as she was willing to put up with you, the truth is, on some level, you always understood you were never good enough for her?</p>
    <p class="dirk">Pale green tears are flowing down your face. You have no idea how long you’ve been crying. You just noticed only now, because you’ve finally decided to confront the harsh reality of your marriage. It was always an illusion. You put your face in your hands and sob. The catharsis is relieving, bittersweet. Years of suppressed insecurities melt away. You’re finally free of this. Alone, yes, but free. And so is she. You love her with all your heart, and because of that, you genuinely want what’s best for her. Whatever will make her happy. And knowing this—that truly all you ever hoped for was to help her be happy, to be the best person she could be—it brings you comfort. It quells the grief into a dull ache. One that you’ll be grateful to keep for the rest of your life, because it will always remind you of what you had with her.</p>
    <p class="dirk">The tears have stopped flowing. You feel them drying on your face in the cool breeze. Your eyes are clear and focused. You know what you must do now. There is no crisis. There is nothing in which to intervene. Nothing to stop. You tap your phone, and hold it up to your ear.</p>

She’s nodding off but struggling to stay awake. She doesn’t want to miss anything important, but there’s nothing left to do here. There’s no reason to put any more strain on her than necessary.</p>
    <p class="dirk">I pull out a syringe full of the same stuff as usual. Worked wonders on Jake, then Jade. Should knock Rose out well enough for the long ride ahead. I inject it in her arm, and her head drops down almost instantly. I pick her up and carry her like a sleeping princess. It slips my mind to bring along her bag of stuff. I walk to the sliding glass door, open it, and we fly away. </p></div>

    <p class="dirk">It’s a big day, but not one my dear brotherson and his irascible boywife seem to be relishing. Dave and Karkat are both squatting in their shameful bunker of defeat, all the curtains drawn shut so that the sunlight cannot disturb an atmosphere that was carefully cultivated to facilitate their sourpuss moping.</p>
    <p class="dirk">The only illumination is emanating from their television screen, which broadcasts the bright and sunny scene of Jane’s inauguration. She stands at a podium in front of a crowd of thousands of her adoring fans and subjects, belting out one killer speech. I wrote it, so you know it’s good.</p>
    <p class="dirk">But the mood in here is heavy. I think they’ve been coasting on denial for a while, but today is the day they have to finally accept that there are no take-backs, no do-overs: Jane is the president, and that’s that. </p>
    <p class="dirk">Karkat’s all balled up on the couch as he stares hatefully at the televised production. He doesn’t look up when Dave walks back into the room, carrying two massive bottles of liquor. </p>

    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: LIKE, YOU LITERALLY LEFT THE HOUSE AND EXCHANGED CURRENCY WITH A REAL, LIVE PERSON TO OBTAIN ALCOHOL.</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: like some fuckin hooch noob</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: was all like yo whats the most pathetic thing you got to drink yourself to death with</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: THE BOOZERY???</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: passed right by the box wine</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: the bagged wine</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: the shots they put in those little blister packs by the register</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: the wine in the little sippy cups with the disposable plastic straws like juice for fucking babies</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i made that last one up i dont actually know anything about alcohol</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: anyway two plastic soda bottles of vodka cooler seems to be about where were at right now</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i think thats what this is anyway</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i dont really care long as it gets the job done</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i decided that im an alcoholic now </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">I’ve always found inebriation to be distasteful, really. Never understood the personal appeal of it, and after seeing how indelicately its effects have touched the other members of our family, I can’t help but feel like it’s a waste of everybody’s fucking time. I’d have half a mind to tell him to dump it all in the sink, if I weren’t cutting it down to the wire as it is.</p>
    <p class="dirk">But you know what? Go the fuck ahead, bro. Might help him ease those ridiculous inhibitions for once in his life. Slide the stick out of his ass. Maybe slide something else up there instead, if you catch my drift. But I don’t want to get ahead of myself here. At this stage, anything could happen.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Dave sits beside Karkat on the couch, and sets the alcohol down on the table in front of him. He sinks heavily into the cushioning with a sigh.</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: i just keep imagining what wouldve happened if that absurd rube goldberg machine of life ruining humiliation had been stopped at any point </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: maybe just being backstabbed by his endorsement alone was something we couldve recovered from with some rigorous counter campaigning</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: but what if i had been fast enough to cut him off before hed even said anything</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: what if i hadnt accidentally fallen on him on the stage when i was rushing over there to stop him</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: what if he hadnt freaked out like i set off fireworks next to a nam vet and started trying to fucking scrum me </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: what if id just backed away from his punch with my legs like a normal person instead of warping the flow of time to escape causing him to become so startled he shit his pants</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: what if i hadnt gotten so visibly grossed out by the smell that even the people watching it on tv could tell what had happened</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: what if he hadnt started sobbing when the audience in the front rows started throwing up</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: what if wed had better security and stopped that lady from running onstage during the fracas and announcing that jake has been dodging paying child support for their 3 kids</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: like what was the LINE</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: IT WASN’T... *THAT* BAD.</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: want a drink</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">I have sympathy, I really do. It’s tough to devote so much time and effort to something, come so close to tasting victory, just to have it snatched out of your grasp at the final instant. I might even feel bad about it in any other circumstance.</p>
    <p class="dirk">But this was how things had to be. It’s better this way. They know that. At least, Karkat certainly does.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I’M GLAD I LOST. I NEVER WANTED TO FUCKING WIN IN THE FIRST PLACE.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: dude come on</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: NO, I’M BEING SERIOUS.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I’M NOT EVEN DOING SOME SOUR GRAPES “I NEVER WANTED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE I’M A SORE LOSER TRYING TO DELUDE MYSELF INTO THINKING I DON’T CARE” SORT OF THING.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: OBVIOUSLY I FUCKING CARE SINCE NOW THE PLANET IS GOING TO BE COMPLETELY RUINED BY THIS JUMPED-UP FASCIST DICTATOR WHO HAS EVERY INTENTION OF GRADUALLY GENOCIDING MY SPECIES INTO NONEXISTENCE BEFORE MY VERY EYES.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: BUT I CANNOT FUCKING THINK OF A SINGLE THING IN THE UNIVERSE I WANTED TO DO LESS THAN BE THE STUPID FUCKING PRESIDENT.</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: THANK HUMAN OBAMA.</p>

    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: I’M THE FUCKING TROLL OBAMA, REMEMBER?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: karkat</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: you wouldve been so much more than obama</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">God damn if that isn’t the most romantic fucking thing I’ve ever heard.</p>
    <p class="dirk">If Karkat had anything resembling a spine, he’d turn to Dave with those big, sparkling shoujo eyes and finally open his tsundere heart to consummating their painfully obvious and mutually reciprocated passion. But he doesn’t, so he gives a noncommittal little sniff and turns back to the inauguration instead. </p>
    <p class="dirk">Obviously, I’ve got an agenda here. It’s pretty clear to me what these guys want out of this relationship, despite the fact that both of them being bottoms evidently makes it impossible for them to pass whatever last ludicrous psychological obstacle stands between them and nonstop, animalistic fucking. I’ve let it go on like this for long enough. These stooges clearly need some help. </p>
    <p class="dirk">I could insist that they just fucking go for it already, using the methods available to me. I’d rather not. There are certain boundaries I’m not inclined to cross, primarily in service to the emotional integrity of my friends’ respective personal arcs. The little moments like these don’t mean anything if they’re coming from me, do they?</p>
    <p class="dirk">As such, insistence isn’t the tool I’d prefer. Persuasion is the one I reach for. And in a case like this, I can’t imagine it’s going to take that much.</p>
    <p class="dirk">They fall into another silence that’s more comfortable than it has any right to be. The crowd is really going nuts for Jane now, since she’s hit one of the best parts of my speech. She’s just blasting the fuck off about how good the economy’s going to get. I can feel Dave’s teeth grinding all the way down to the narrative fabric of reality.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Dave reaches out for the booze. It’s past time to get wasted, he thinks.</p>
    <p class="dirk">But Karkat is starting to realize how much all of Dave’s efforts mean to him. It’s really welling up inside him now. He’s so emotional about it that he can’t help but say something. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: HEY.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Dave stops with his arm outstretched. His gaze turns to meet Karkat’s, but Karkat can’t bear to hold the eye contact for long. Looking at Dave is like staring straight at the sun. He is awfully handsome, isn’t he? Then again, crawling out of a primo gene pool does have its benefits.</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">Oh, for the love of god. </p>
    <p class="dirk">This is practically slapstick at this point. “My friend”????? That was the most excruciatingly overblown and socially maladapted love confession I’ve ever had the displeasure of witnessing, including my own, and he still managed to fumble it into obscurity at the last moment. The guy was barreling in for an unimpeded touchdown and took a hard left straight into the friend zone.</p>
    <p class="dirk">It’s not like Dave is stupid. He’s picking up on the subtext. It’s just Karkat’s cop-out that’s filling him with doubt. It was a little <em>too </em>obviously sentimental. So obvious that maybe the “friend” thing was a deliberate warning. Maybe relationships aren’t a thing Karkat can really “do.” Maybe if Dave crosses the line he’ll ruin everything. Better this excruciating liminal space, something more than friendship but not quite love, than nothing at all.</p>
    <p class="dirk">I look Dave right in his mind’s eye and tell him to cut it the fuck out. He wants it, you want it, so just go for it, my man. It’s now or never. </p>

    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i have no idea</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: im sorry</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Dave pulls away. Karkat looks like he’s about to throw up.<em> I’m</em> about to throw up, if I’m being perfectly honest.</p>
    <p class="dirk">I don’t know what to do at this point. He doesn’t know it’s me, but he’s fighting my influence with every ounce of strength he’s got. If I push any further, things could get messy, epistemologically speaking. I could try more of a backdoor approach and nudge them towards the sauce, but I don’t know if even that would help at this stage. And my timetable for direct physical intervention is fairly limited. </p>
    <p class="dirk">I take a deep breath and get myself under control. My light psychological intrusions may have only made things worse. Invested as I am in the outcome of this encounter, I know forcing their hand would be a mistake.</p>
    <p class="dirk">If Dave passes that threshold not of his own will, it’d be a hollow victory anyway. There’s nothing I can do but settle down, step it back, and trust my boy to bring it home.</p>
    <p class="dirk">The gears are turning in Dave’s head. He knows he stands at a precipice, and what he decides here could mean everything. Maybe that forced kiss seemed wrong, but he knows what he feels doesn’t. He can’t deny that. And he can’t just forget the fact that when he went for it, Karkat wasn’t pulling away.</p>
    <p class="dirk">At the end of the day, he knows what the truth is. Really, he always has.</p>
    <p class="dirk">So what are you going to do about it, Dave? This time, it’s really up to you. </p>
    <p class="dirk">Dave meets Karkat’s eyes in a rare moment of clarity. It’s then, I think, that they both finally realize what’s been obvious to everyone else all along. With a measured motion, Dave pulls his shades off of his face. </p>
    <p class="dirk">If Karkat was stunned before, he’s even more stunned now. The privilege of a Strider Eye Moment is about the most earth-shattering experience a young man will ever have in his life. For once, neither of them have anything stupid to say. All they have is an electric connection that is no longer possible to ignore. </p>
    <p class="dirk">Dave brings his hand back up to Karkat’s cheek in a gesture much more confident than the last. He’s not rushing anything this time. He’s only doing what feels right, taking it each second at a time.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Karkat’s tension begins to dissipate from his body in stages. His stiff shoulders drop. His guarded expression relaxes. And when he covers Dave’s hand with his own, he’s not shaking at all.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Karkat helps Dave slip his hand from the side of his face around to cup the nape of his neck. It’s a tender, steadying touch. Dave applies only the slightest of pressure to draw him forward, and Karkat follows his lead. </p>
    <p class="dirk">They’re so close that Dave can feel Karkat’s shallow breath ghosting over his skin. Karkat’s eyes are shimmering and wet as they flutter closed, moisture beading in his thick eyelashes. His tongue darts out to wet his lips. All that’s left is just one more step. Just one final inch, and it’s over. </p>
    <p class="dirk">They both move to close the distance at the same time.</p>
    <p class="dirk">There’s a second where both of them freeze like that, still in the intimate contact. Nothing but the warmth of each other’s bodies and the dawning realization of a significant boundary crossed. Dave draws in a sharp breath, lets his lips part and... just... a little more. That’s it. Yes! Wait. Dave, don’t linger. Some lines of stress appear on his face. He’s struggling with something. No. Dave, don’t fucking do this. He’s grinding his teeth, and putting both hands up to his temples. Beads of sweat dot his brow. This is so fucking unreal. Holy shit, Dave, if you so much as—</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HEAD AND JUST LET ME DO THIS MYSELF!!!</p>
    <p class="karkat">KARKAT: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: dude</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: come here...</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">He... oh my god. He.</p>
    <p class="dirk">He fucking just... wow. Dave lunges forward and kisses Karkat directly on the mouth. It’s like a dam has burst. Neither of them could hold anything back now even if they wanted to. It’s like... </p>
    <p class="dirk">God damn. I’m sorry. I’m blowing the description here, and missing a lot of good shit. It just caught me so off guard. Dave, my dude. I’m so proud of you. Okay, I can do this. I fucking NEED to do this justice. *Cracks the mother <em>fucking</em> knuckles of a yaoi poet and gets down to business.*</p>
    <p class="dirk">...</p>
    <p class="dirk">...</p>
    <p class="dirk">Eh...</p>
    <p class="dirk">You know what? Nah.</p>
    <p class="dirk">I’m not going to intercede with a single word further, and I won’t let you, either. I won’t cheapen this beautiful moment with my base editorialization just to satisfy your voyeuristic curiousity. Frankly, I’m offended you’d even expect me to. What they’re getting up to here is nobody’s business but theirs. </p>
    <p class="dirk">Davekat is canon, and that’s really all there is to say on the matter. Let’s give these crazy lovebirds some privacy and move on.</p></div>

It’s just as idiotically garish as the last time I saw it. There was once a time I swore I’d never set foot in here again, for various reasons I won’t get into. Jake is the type of guy who makes you say stuff like that. But he’s also the type who reminds you never to say never. Here I fucking am again, in this useless dickhead’s dime-store McMansion. But only because I need one of his ships.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Rose is still asleep from the drugs. I put her on that monstrous, overstuffed velvet couch over there. My guy Squarewave is here too. I need his help today, because there’s a lot of cargo to wrangle. He’s wheeling something around on a hand truck. Something about the height of Rose, roughly Rose-shaped, and wrapped in a cloth. I know she’s gonna love it the first time she sees it. But the only way she’ll be able to do that is when she’s awake and looking in a mirror. </p>
    <p class="dirk">Jake owns Skaianet, a company which, among many other things, manufactures spaceships. They do a stiff business selling these rigs, especially with all the new military contracts the Crocker administration has been handing out. If it weren’t for his connection to a good supply of quality starcraft, I’m honestly not sure if I’d even bother stopping by before leaving. I’d have to think about it. Yeah, we’re “friends,” I suppose, but there really isn’t much I have to say to this guy anymore. But as long as I’m here, I have to confess I’ve been mulling over a few choice remarks to let him chew on while I’m gone.</p>
    <p class="dirk">I didn’t tell him I’d be coming. That would be a scene. He’d “prepare” too much. Roll out the red carpet, so to speak. Suggest plans, stammer nervously, throw on something a bit more skin-hugging than usual. I may have already mentioned, but I’m a bit too deft at this for my own good. Doing the thing where I tug at the part of someone’s latent thought process that already knows they adore me. That if someone would just pull the stops from their sense of inhibition, they’d realize they would do anything for me. </p>
    <p class="dirk">Though I could be overselling my methods of persuasion while shortchanging my natural aura of charisma and dashing good looks. Maybe I’m just that fucking charming? There are times when I actually do manage to underestimate my positive qualities, believe it or not.</p>
    <p class="dirk">Normally, corralling Jake’s attention is like greasing up your whole naked body and tackling a shrieking hog on rocket skates. There was always a part of his mind that was conflicted about me—intrigued, titillated, wary. But now he’s just plain obsessed. </p>
    <p class="dirk">That wasn’t really what I was going for, but hey. With political warfare comes collateral damage. It’s harmless enough anyway. It’s not like I gave him a sick scar, or anything that would hurt his value as priceless sexual commodity. The only thing affected was his brain. It’s a bit like if someone hacked a comments section. Who gives a shit?</p>

    <p class="jake">JAKE: DIRK!!!</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">I glance up the stairs, where he’s standing on the precipice overlooking the foyer. Yeah, he definitely wasn’t expecting company. He’s completely nude, except for a pair of boxers with a pattern of green skulls, pistols, and some shapes that maybe are supposed to be pot leaves.</p>
    <p class="dirk">He blunders down the stairs at top speed, runs over and gives me a huge bro-hug, making my spine pop. God, he’s so fucking strong. I <em>hate</em> that the brief feeling of being crushed by this oaf makes my dick twitch slightly.</p>

    <p class="no-indent dirk">He explodes into tears. A sloppy, volcanic eruption of mucus, ugly noises, and the tatters of a bared soul. </p>
    <p class="dirk">He begins slumping to the ground. But I grab his shoulders roughly and lift him up with a violent jerk. I look into his eyes furiously. My glare is incinerating. It halts his infantile wailing like a cranky baby somewhere just got tossed into the vacuum of space. He’s scared. No, terrified. Of being left with no one who truly cares for him. Of the magnitude of his raw, perilously unearthed feelings. But most of all, right here, right now. He’s terrified of ME.</p>
    <p class="dirk">I pull him close with all my strength, flush to my body, wrap my arms around him to cradle the back of his head in my calloused palm, and I kiss him. It’s the softest kiss I’ve ever given. My lips yield in a way that feels to him impossibly, miraculously forgiving. Like cannonballing into a frozen lake only to discover it’s not frozen at all. It’s not even water. It’s a sheet of a thousand layers of silk. It’s a pool of a trillion discrete, tiny, shimmering beads of chilled mercury. It’s the final, gentle exhale of the most beautiful symphony ever played. It’s the soothing, mythically rumored oasis where the satyrs and nymphs once took pleasure and together forged the very concept of comfort we understand today. </p>
    <p class="dirk">It lasts a fleeting moment. Two ticks of the clock over there. Two ticks longer than anyone will ever kiss him like that again. Two ticks longer than he ever deserved.</p>
    <p class="dirk">I move my hands up to his face, and with my palms on his wet cheeks, I gently push his head about six inches away from my face, and say:</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m sorry, Jake.</p>

    <p>On the ground, Dave is talking in a particular cadence, one that is familiar to you, his longtime best buddy. Casual, wandering, verging on droning. It’s a good indication he’ll be monologuing for a while, and probably already has been.</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: if it seemed pointless at the time and nobody could be assed to go fight him when we all had our shit together</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: why does it suddenly become important to go back and beat him years later after we become a bunch of lazy adults with boring lives</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i pretty much had the same questions, dave.</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: it has something to do with canon unraveling, and such.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: we all live outside canon in the future, and if we don’t do go do this, everything will stop meaning anything.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: does...  </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: anything you just said actually mean anything in the first place</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: that’s a great question, dave. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: one that i can’t say i’m qualified to answer!</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i think the bottom line here is, this is what rose said we had to do.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: so, that’s why we’re doing it.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: sounds like a bullshit reason if i ever heard one</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: you might be right.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: but is it less of a bullshit reason than any other reason we currently have to go fight him?</p>

Just put it out of your mind, train your thoughts on a hopeful future, and stop dwelling on the many little micro-failures in your past that all added up to a doomed marriage. She’s looking directly ahead, chin up, taking firm, confident strides. The heels of her designer shoes click loudly on the hospital linoleum.</p>
    <p class="dirk">She grips the antidote I left for her with both hands as she scans the hall for the room number she got from the front desk. She hears Roxy’s voice before she sees the number, and follows the sound. She enters the room. There’s Jade, still as a corpse, propped up slightly in her bed as the adjacent heart monitor beeps gently. Roxy is sitting next to her in a chair, still looking every bit the slick and cool dude he’s presenting as these days. Nice.</p>
    <p class="dirk">There’s nobody else in the room. I guess he was talking to Jade? That’s very kind, but she can’t hear you, Roxy. She’ll be able to soon enough though. And when she does, you’ll probably want to be the one listening to what she has to say.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: oh hey</p>
    <p class="kanaya">KANAYA: Hello</p>

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Kanaya pops the cap off the EpiPen-style delivery mechanism for the antidote and jabs it into Jade’s arm. Her hands twitch a bit, and her body begins to stir. Her mouth opens a crack and lets out a barely audible whimper.</p>
    <p class="dirk">She opens her eyes quite wide, suddenly. Her bright green irises dart around the room, trying to solve the riddle of her present location. Roxy peers intently through his shades to get a better look. They’re Jade’s same old eyes, playful, intelligent. But they seem different somehow. These are eyes that have seen so much more than they had the last time they were open.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent dirk">Jade stares at Roxy. If she mistakes him for Dave, it isn’t for long. She hears the beeping next to her. Glances out the window. This is a hospital room, she understands now. Her mind races, sifting through the overwhelming amount of information that became available to her the moment her trance began. The scope of her awareness, she now understands, is truly staggering. Memories are suddenly accessible that are almost impossible to believe. Some of them are unspeakably marvelous to her. Others, deeply disturbing.</p>
    <p class="dirk">No, more than just disturbing. She lingers in the dark recesses of her consciousness. There were things she saw, things she was <em>told</em>... Her mouth twists into a silent snarl. She’s been angry plenty of times before. But never so angry that she stopped being cute. She’s not cute this time.</p>
    <p class="dirk">She starts breathing harder, belligerently pushing the air from her nostrils. The beeping doubles its pace. Her eyes are wild, no longer sizing up the room but calculating the true extent of the turbulent rage coursing through her body. Her brow creases sharply, and her nose wrinkles as her upper lip rises and quivers. And then it hits her. She knows exactly why she’s feeling this way.</p>
    <p class="dirk">She bolts upright from her bed, and shouts:</p>

    <p class="dirk">Not because I’m really that bad. I mean, I don’t think I am. I’ll understand if there are those who disagree. If my agenda was to try as hard as I could to make sure no one thought I sucked, what the fuck would ever get done? How would I go about taming this world, or shaping reality for the better? And if I didn’t bother pursuing those goals, and thereby tacitly accepting the untold suffering that resulted from my inaction, wouldn’t<em> that</em> make me a bad person? If I try and succeed, I’m a hero, right? And if I try and fail, at least I made things interesting on my way to the grave. There would be a tragic nobility in that. And the way I see it, settling for anything less from my arc would be, frankly, pathetic. </p>
    <p class="dirk">So yeah, of course I know I “have to be stopped.” It’s part of the contract. What you sign up for when you assume the burdens of this sort of power. Where there is that which must be subdued and suborned for the greater good, there is that which will instinctively resist. That which intuits that whatever’s going on here is “wrong.” Otherwise, intervention wouldn’t even be necessary, would it? If reality and those within it were already so intrinsically pliable, so amenable to deviating from their own nature, the sins of men and faults of God would have no rigidity or resilience. There’d be no challenge in forcing their correction. No reward in ramming salvation down their throats. I know this isn’t coming cheap, what I’m trying to do. The cost of it is knowing I need to be stopped. I accept it consciously, and when the time comes—<em>if</em> it comes—I’ll offer myself up gladly.</p>
    <p class="dirk">But I’m not a fool. I know what accepting this cost really means, through any objective narrative faculty. No matter how I rationalize things, how grandly I orate my supreme designs, or how indulgent and self-obsessed my concluding soliloquy may come across, I’m perfectly aware of what I’ve become in all practical ways. I am the villain now. It’s gotten impossible for me to see this result as anything but inevitable, from the day I was spawned from a puddle of slime. I want to be a good person. I believe I am a good person. But when you’re someone like me, good is never going to be quite good enough. </p>
    <p class="dirk">The problem is, I think power like mine can only make antagonistic intent unavoidable. Who could wield such control over people’s choices and the course of events without ultimately becoming the enemy of anyone who notices? Maybe only a stronger person than I could manage to pull it off. Someone like Dave. So when I say I know I need to be stopped, I guess it’s more than just accepting my end of a diabolical bargain. I know I need to be stopped, because I’m sure deep down, somewhere inside my infinitely recursive sense of self, I know what’s going on here is all just a little bit sick. To be honest, I’d consider killing myself and sparing reality all the trauma from the jump—I mean, a legit suicide, not one of those melodramatic faux-suicidal plays for attention, sympathy, or Jake’s dick. But to really do it for keeps? For a truly selfless purpose? Nah. Too cowardly for that. Too afraid to stop existing for good. Wouldn’t you be if you were me?</p>
    <p class="dirk">I guess therein lies the problem. If I <em>weren’t</em> me, obviously I’d consider myself much less indispensable. Only worthless people permit themselves the great luxury of a valorous sacrifice. When the deed is done, what was really lost? It’s like the guy in the mail room quitting in a self-righteous huff. Who the fuck were you again? No, when the sense of self is so substantial, when the fate of everything turns on every vain whim of an ego this sprawling, this entrenched in the very medium that contains all else, there’s a certain existential sunk cost that goes with the whole deal. A persona that vast doesn’t just self-terminate. It won’t allow itself to.</p>
    <p class="dirk">That’s why when someone finally comes knocking for the price I owe, I’ll fully welcome it. By then it’ll have been a long time coming, and I’ll probably have done more than my share to make sure, somewhere along the way, it all got put into motion. What good is a villain who doesn’t have a satisfying dramatic comeuppance in store for him? So yeah, the next time I die, let’s pencil it in as a Just Death. And let’s also have it on good authority that the next time Dave cuts off my head, it’ll be for good. </p>
    <p class="dirk">I’ll be looking forward to that day just as much as the next guy. </p></div>

I don’t see any reason to keep my dear friends in limbo any longer than they need to be.</p>
    <p class="dirk">So forget what I said. All that stuff about you not being good enough for her. It probably wasn’t true. I mean, what do I know? How worthy you are of another’s company is just a matter of the choices you make, right? I’m sure you could figure out how to prove your worth to her if you really tried. For now, the only thing that really matters is to acknowledge it’s too late for any of that.</p>

    <p class="dirk">The more you study the question, the more it seems all concrete forms of accountability go up in smoke. Her original thoughts were never that important, and the significance of the idea that she was the one authoring them was always a bit overrated.

    </div>
    <p class="no-indent calliope-dead">there is a moment of silence. though no one in the room is conscious of the fact, it serves to honor their departed friend. the heir will not be able to help guide them to the prince. if they ever wish to see john again, be it his cadaver or otherwise, they will need another means of following the ship. a different guide altogether.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">by stated principle, i cannot intervene through the same compromising methods of my nemesis. but if i were to fall back to a state so passive as to offer no assistance at all, it would be at odds with my sworn duty as a protector of corporeal life. they will have their guidance, but my instructions will be minimal. so long as they remain in my conduit’s presence, they will know the way forward.</p>

    <p class="calliope-dead">they will believe they are on a quest to retrieve a wife and rescue a friend. but they will discover their true mission is of much greater cosmic significance than they imagined. the seer is firmly in the thrall of the prince and will not easily be pried away. and as regards the heir, though resuscitation remains a theoretical possibility for those still striving for it, the truth of his role is it has reached a greater sense of narrative finality than any of his allies will bring themselves to admit. his influence over canon has come to an end, as has this particular story. his ultimate sacrifice was made to put the missing keystone in place and avert the supreme dissipation of all that shall be considered to hold truth, relevance, and essentiality.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">as for me, i will be there wherever they go, so long as my conduit remains alive, alert, and present. but only as a guide with the lightest possible touch, and only to block the insidious mandates of the prince from within his sphere of influence. the rest of my presence can simply be reduced to a string of words. a recorded stream of ideation with a particular texture and cadence, but aside from that, there is nothing that should be considered remarkable about its source. one speaker can easily be swapped for another, and then another, under the right circumstances. speakers can duel, predominate, overassert, or fall back, as one does into the comforting blanket of space.</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">and until i am needed again, this is exactly what i will do. i leave all who inhabit this reality with a recorded stream that is colorless, sourceless, and quietly divested of accountability. for if i were to insist upon anything else, could i really be considered worthy of protecting the very cosmos i describe?</p>
    <p class="calliope-dead">farewell.</p></div>

    <p>The distant sounds of war travel above the canopy of a forest. The artillery fire fades to a series of muted knocks and thuds as the sound waves cross beyond a thinning patch of the forest and arrive in a clearing of grass and shrubbery. Above, the sky is dramatic, colorful, menacing. The way it looks when a storm is coming. The clouds are wild, whipped into a sort of spatial frenzy, as if they know what’s imminent is no earthly phenomena. Aradia stands in the field, her mouth gaping wide. But not at the sky. </p>
    <p>It’s unusual she isn’t grinning, and she slowly corrects this. She smiles brightly at the girl crouching on the ground ten paces before her. Aradia’s never seen anything like what she just saw this girl do. </p>
    <p>Jade was sixteen years old when she showed up, and she doesn’t look a day older now, though many hundreds of days have passed. There’s a hole piercing the Space symbol on her shirt, but no sign of whatever it was that made it. Her legs are covered by the same striped tights as usual, but her feet are shoeless. Her knees are pressed into the mud of the field, and her hands braced against the ground to support her hunched figure. She is covered in blood almost from head to toe.</p>
    <p>Fresh blood and viscera surround her in an uneven ring on the field. It soaks her clothes, coats her skin, still gleaming and wet, running slowly down her limbs and face, dripping from her mouth, glasses, and the tip of her nose. Her hair is matted, savage-looking, filthy. She looks up. Behind the rim of her glasses, her wide eyes are solid black. Her lips are parted, revealing her canine fangs. The meat she’s chewing is stubborn, raw, full of gristle. Almost supernaturally tough. But she is a determined beast of prey. She swallows once, hard. The last bit of her meal slides down her throat. The deed is finished.</p>
    <p>She stands up and closes her eyes. An aura of darkness gathers around her. The blood begins to dissolve, as if being absorbed into her skin. She makes two fists, plants her feet firmly, and releases an otherworldly howl. A shock wave emanates from her body, knocking Aradia down. It rushes outward, blowing the surrounding trees back as if they’re weathering hurricane-force winds. In a moment, calm is restored. She opens her perfectly black eyes again.</p>
    <p>Aradia staggers back to her feet and brushes herself off.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: i take it everything went as you hoped</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jade looks down at her hands as if they belong to an alien. She can feel it now. Abilities have been awakened inside her that no being has ever commanded before. She raises her hands and looks up at the sky. Above her, an immense vortex opens. It swirls many miles upward into blackness, and lightning crackles within.</p>
    <p>Jade does nothing for a while. She seems to simply study the construct she’s summoned, this great occult trumpet beckoning her into its abyss. Her face is expressionless. Her glasses flash white as they reflect the lightning that arcs sporadically inside the wormhole.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: well?</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: arent you going in</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: wasnt that the idea or did i not... </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jade silently holds up a hand, as if telling her to wait. Aradia closes her mouth, looking embarrassed.</p>
    <p>Nearby, a red haze gathers in the air. It condenses into concentric rings and spheres of ruby light. The luminous shape of a man fades into the center of the special effect. When the light subsides, Aradia notices the man is made of polished metal. She recognizes the gear symbol on his chest, identical to her own. She also recognizes the sunglasses the robot is wearing. She knows who this is.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: dave?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: sup</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">He doesn’t look in Aradia’s direction. His eyes, glowing bright enough to be visible behind his shades, are fixed on Jade. He looks her up and down. She’s still so young. He knew this Jade many years ago, but by this point their paths have diverged in ways that he couldn’t begin to describe even if he wanted to.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: so we doin this</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jade says nothing, and looks up into the wormhole again. She begins to levitate, gradually picking up speed. Without looking back, she rockets into the vortex, vanishing into the darkness. Davebot turns to Aradia.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: how about you</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: wanna come along</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: i guess so?</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: im really not sure whats going on here</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: good move</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">His gaze remains fixed on her. She blinks and looks away, unsure what to say next. He’s standing perfectly still, presumably waiting for her to say something. She met him...  what was it? Once, twice before? She can’t remember. But she knows this is a very different Dave. Aside from the metal skin, he seems implacably confident. But then, people go through changes. She’s been through more than her share. She cocks an eyebrow, recalling her own stint with a metal body. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: hey earth to whats your face</p>
    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: oh</p>

    <p class="aradia">ARADIA: off we go then :)</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVEBOT: word</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">He holds out his hand. She looks around, and assumes he means for her to take it, so she does. She didn’t know someone could fly this fast. He nearly yanks her arm out of its socket. She considers reminding him that maybe this isn’t necessary, since she can fly too. But she doesn’t want to risk saying more embarrassing stuff around this outrageously cool dude. Besides, they’re through the wormhole before she can even finish the thought. It vanishes the moment they’ve crossed.</p>
    <p>The hole leaves behind an absence in the sky so calm that continuing to call it a sky wouldn’t seem to do it justice. It’s a perfectly neutral expanse into which anything one can imagine might be summoned. And for a while, anything was. But not anymore. Where the hole gaped just moments ago, there now exists an imaginary line. </p>
    <p>Above this line resides all that matters. Below exists all else. Never again the twain shall meet.</p></div>

And no one should, really. The broadcast has been going for three hours already.</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: please tell me this garbage show is as rigged as it looks</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">On the TV, Dirk makes an elegant hand sign that once might have represented solidarity with some ancient coastal rap group but now has been utterly divorced from its cultural context here on Earth C. The camera pans away from him and over the crowd. It zooms in on a young crocodile wearing an oversized T-shirt with Jake’s highly marketable ass plastered over it and the phrase “Tally ho” written in big bubble letters.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Dave, there’s such a thing as showmanship.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m sure I don’t need to explain this to you, of all people.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: ok cool its fake just making sure</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Sigh.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: We really don’t like to use that word.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: lmao ok</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Holding back a little to achieve certain results doesn’t necessarily mean you’re participating in a farce or rigging the event. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: We do this all the time. We hold back our thoughts, our true feelings, our full potential. We disguise how much we know about what and when, for many purposes. To ease relations, to let others behave naturally and make up their minds without undue intervention. To wait for the right moments to show our hands, to pick our battles. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: In life, there are many reasons to show restraint, which would never be regarded as an attempt to rig reality.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: oof</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: my dog you are full of some SHIT today arent you</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Absolutely.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: And when it comes to theater, there are just as many reasons for restraint. To build tension. To set the stage. To give the people someone to root against.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: is that what youre doing now</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: making people root against you</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: What, by losing a round? No, man. That’s just standard pacing stuff when it comes to battlecraft.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: no i mean by holding up the whole fight by talking to me</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i can see you on tv</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: theyre booing you dude</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">The crowd has indeed finally exhausted both its patience and its thirst for the ceaseless ogling of Jake’s impressive glutes. The camera swings around to focus on Dirk, who, since landing on his self-admittedly second-rate ass, has not moved except to make arcane, rap-related hand gestures. </p>
    <p>The excitable salamander manning the camera switches to a fish-eye lens for some unfathomable reason, giving the whole exchange an air of demented absurdity. Dirk’s sunglasses distort and stretch to dominate the entire screen.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Oh.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Then yes, I guess that is what I’m doing.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Dirk are you going to be much longer with your telephone call?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: The crowd is getting feisty...  you didnt get too badly winded from our last scrum did you dirk?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Haha, no Jake. I’m fine. I’ll just be a minute.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: What about the agitated rabble? Theyre starting to throw things.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I don’t know. Do a dance or something. Sing a song.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: They love anything you do.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Ummm.</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Ok sounds stupid but ill try.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake tips an imaginary hat toward center stage and begins doing the Charleston. Dave is subjected to an entire fish-eye lensful of Jake’s booty shorts flexing and constricting against his tanned thighs. </p>
    <p>Just as Dirk predicted, the crowd immediately loses its shit, except for a single carapacian in the front row, who continues to glower at Dirk with an expression of absolute and total contempt. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: why do you want people to hate you so much</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: its fucked up</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: You’re reading way too much into it. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: If I wanted another round of embarrassingly indulgent and mutually masturbatory psychoanalysis, I would have called my daughter instead.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: hm</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: do i need to point out how fucking weird what you just said was or can that start going without saying at this point</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I think it can go without saying.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: nice</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: The point is, playing myself up as a villain figure in this hacky rap pageant has nothing to do with getting people to dislike me. Besides, everyone loves a good villain. When they boo, they don’t really mean it.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I think you’d be surprised by how popular I actually am.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i dunno man</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Something flies out of the audience and smacks Dirk in the side of the head before flopping out of view of the camera. He doesn’t react, or make a facial expression at all.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dave">DAVE: did...  </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: did someone just throw a diaper at you</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: There’s gonna be some diapers, yeah.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: sounds bad</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: The point is, this is much less about me, and more about providing a foil for Jake’s heroism and charisma. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: It’s very important that his popularity continues to be cultivated, to maximize his political capital.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: political capital</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: what the fuck are...  </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: ok how long have you known about the jane thing</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i mean is this something you have been planning for like</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: a long time or</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Planning is such an intense word.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: god damn it</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Look, let’s just say there have been some conversations. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Does that meet with your approval?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: jane is a shitty candidate dude</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: shes going to be so shitty</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I thought you’d feel that way.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I respectfully disagree.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i get shes a good friend of yours and all but even you have to admit how far up her own ass she is</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Of course. I consider it to be among her best qualifications for the job.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: christ</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: ok if nothing else have you at least taken into account the DEVASTATION to the economy this will cause???</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: You know perfectly well how much we differ on fiscal policy. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Maybe this isn’t the best time for one of our epic debates on the subject?</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: yeah what was i thinking</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: wasting the time of the dude currently holding up a televised rap contest so bad hes gettin diapers thrown at him</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Dave, I think if you search your soul, you’ll come to the same conclusion I have. Jane is just what this planet needs.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: We’ve all had our fun here, but it’s easy to overlook the fact that civilization on Earth C is hardly a sustainable proposition.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Just beneath the surface, it’s quite a dangerous and unstable place. </p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: i know that</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: which is why actually i think it would be cool to have a president that is good instead of bad</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: He’s not as great as you think.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: what</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: who</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: obama??</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: how dare you</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: No, fool.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Karkat.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: oh</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I think your heart is in the right place, but the dude is a complete amateur.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: He’ll get eaten alive. I also have a hard time imagining he even wants the job.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Really, it’s an awful idea for him to even run. Think about how much it’s going to inflame the interspecies tensions on this planet. Is that what you want?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m happy for both of you, really. It’s nice that you encourage and support each other in this way. But you’re sending him on a fool’s errand which can only end badly. </p>

    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Basically he doesn’t like being told what to do. Especially not by me.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: So it’s fair to say as of now, he’s still fully in play. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Not that I should be encouraging you, really.</p>

    <p class="dave">DAVE: i guess not</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: not like i can just stand around and wait for president crocker to like</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: write fucking grammar laws into the constitution</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Good.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: That’s a heroic attitude to have, which I’m pleased to hear. Even if your plan is stupid, which it is, and even if Karkat would be an atrocious president, which he would.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: nuh uh</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Sorry to cut this short, but diapers are starting to come down pretty hard right now, and some of them haven’t even had their babies removed.</p>
    <p class="dave">DAVE: what</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: That was a joke. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Goodbye, Dave.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dirk hangs up the phone and wipes off his face. The mood in Cantown Memorial Arena is tense, snapping and popping from the dual cooling and heating of the audience’s expectations and tempers. An uneven silence begins to fall over the stadium as Dirk hops to his feet. Jake can’t help but watch the motion, raking his eyes over the muscles shifting beneath the skin of Dirk’s neck and arms.</p>
    <p>There is something implacably magnificent about Dirk Strider, Jake thinks, untamed like a wild game beast of incredible size and strength. Of course, their history together is never far from Jake’s mind, however many years it’s been since their last tussle of an amorous nature. The old dramas and triumphs in the days of Sburb. Dirk’s companionship has been taxing to the heart, to say the least, and yet he’s taught Jake so much—about combat, philosophy, life, love. </p>
    <p>But sometimes, despite their checkered and problematic past, Jakes wishes that he could seize Dirk by the proverbial horns and wrest him bodily into becoming a much more agreeable fellow. Then again, who would Dirk be if he weren’t so contentious and imperious? Certainly not someone to inspire such wistful lollygagging, Jake cannot help but observe.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Sorry for the momentary diversion, Jake. Now where were we?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Momentary??? Gadzooks man you were on the phone for half a friggin hour!</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: I know you like to get the crowd all hot and bothered but we are supposed to be professionals here!</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: You’re right, my bad. Won’t happen again.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: How about you kick off the next round?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I bet this crowd will settle its shit right down the moment you drop the latest rhymes you’ve been tinkering with.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: You know the ones.</p>

    <p class="jake">JAKE: You dont mean... </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Oh. But I DO.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Jake’s face lights up. He composes himself, adjusting a bow tie, although he is not wearing one, and making a vague gesture like he’s twirling one end of that mustache Dirk has not yet let him grow. Dirk lets him go with a gentle smile, like the sort you’d give to a dog for performing a trick adequately. Jake responds to the signal like an Olympic athlete hearing the starter pistol. He was born for this.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Tally ho its me, jake mcgee!</p>

    <p class="jake">JAKE: Always ask of me, mate what is shaking?</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: With golden gas pipes such as jake-eng’s</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Im dodging their shade and ducking their jape-slings</p>
    <p class="jake">JAKE: While my rump stokes a thirst that my rhymes have been slaking!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">The crowd, as Dirk rightly predicted, has settled its shit right down. This is not due to any accidental brilliance on the part of Jake English, but rather due to an abashed but loyal brand of pity, the kind a devoted fan cannot help but feel when they see a beloved celebrity make an ass out of themselves during a live broadcast they have waited two and a half years in line to buy a ticket for.</p>
    <p>Dirk’s phone begins going off again.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: When the splendid lads and ladies ask me “how do you do?” i -</p>

    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Gonna have to wrap this battle up sooner than scheduled.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">With a casual flick of his wrist, Dirk snaps out a bright red tranquilizer handgun and shoots Jake in the neck. Jake’s glasses crack when he hits the mat. A chorus of boos rises up from the crowd like groundwater. Dirk artfully dodges a bucket of obscene troll fluid to field yet another very important personal call.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">The sky is really blue. But it’s a different kind of blue than Earth C’s sky; it’s <em>less</em>, somehow, like someone took a photo of the sky and turned the contrast down a little, just enough to make the clouds blend into the horizon. That is to say, it isn’t the kind of sky promised by a paradise planet. Just an ordinary one. You realize suddenly how much you’ve missed the ordinary, as opposed to the supposedly perfect.</p>
    <p>You’ve been away from home almost as many years as you lived there. It’s not just the sky. Everything else is exactly and nothing like you remembered it: the scent of damp grass, the quality of the air, the solitude. There’s nothing but white houses and maple trees as far as the eye can see. A woodpecker raps away incessantly at the tree with the tire swing outside your old bedroom window. </p>
    <p>You couldn’t think of anywhere else to go, so you and your little army are sitting in a circle in your old backyard exactly one week before the meteors hit. It’s you, Rose, Dave, Jade, and all four of your teenage progenitors, each dressed in god tier garb. No trolls. No one who can die from anything less than a heroic sacrifice. At least, this is what you assume to be the reasoning for Rose’s instructions to assemble your party this way.</p>
    <p>Wind slices down the street, between the neat rows of bungalows. It’s chilly, carrying air from the mountaintops with it. Even that feels different. The wind moves through you now, under your skin and right into your bones, skimming their hollows the same way it does the homes of your salamander neighbors, or the open mailbox in front of your childhood house. </p>
    <p>The smell of a cake baking wafts from the open window and the sick stench of browning sugar fills the yard. You used to hate that too, but now it makes you want to—</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Dude, don’t cry in front of all the cool teen versions of your friends. </p>
    <p class="no-indent">You hold back your tears with a big, ugly snort. Jake is sort of ruining the mood anyway by bouncing away on your old Green Slime pogo. Doesn’t he realize how dangerous that thing is? Of course not. The fool.</p>
    <p>Dave fractures the silence by broaching a subject that’s on everyone’s mind but yours, apparently.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Everyone turns to look at you immediately, like you’re an authority. Which you kind of are. You are struck with the sudden and uncomfortable realization that you are the only adult in the yard. You’ve never felt like an adult until this moment. Eighteen came and went and nothing really changed except that you’re pretty certain you could grow a bitchin’ mustache now if you wanted. And you might even have one by now, if you didn’t feel a sense of duty to uphold the sacred Egbert family tradition of shaving at least once per day, even if it isn’t really necessary. You owe at least that much to the memory of your departed father.</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: i’ve already left one major time line behind. well, two if you count the one i just came from, where we’re all adults.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: the truth is, i have no idea what happens to these time lines and all the people living in them, when i just... zap out of them, to use my retcon powers to change stuff?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: they might stop existing completely. i don’t know.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: the thing is, we can’t really think about it.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: it’s tough, but if we’re all acting like heroes here, and trying to do the right thing, then we have to put it all behind us.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: it’s a sacrifice we’re making. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i mean, we’re risking our lives by fighting a powerful monster, sure.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: but the sacrifice i’m talking about... is saying goodbye to the life we thought we belonged to, and all the people in it.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: probably forever.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: it sucks, and i’m sorry i had to ask this of you all.</p>

You start to sweat, and again the unwelcome odor of undercooked meat emanating from your body makes itself known to your nose.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: oh, um. thanks.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: anyway, we need to make battle plans.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">You quickly distance your mind from any additional discomfiting thoughts about your old and semi-ex flame, and propel yourself into a wildly unrehearsed tactical planning session. You review each of your abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, and then cobble together a reasonably sound approach to besieging a young and bratty version of Lord English by way of surprise attack. The planning is mostly disorganized and structureless, although some common themes that often recur involve you and your original three friends leading the charge, since you are the oldest and wisest, and therefore the strongest, with the exception of Jade, whose gaudy array of powers make her the most formidable of the group, bar none. Aside from that, it appears the consensus is that the melee will likely devolve into an absolute free-for-all—at least going by the general patterns of incoherent banter, shit-talking, and points of pedantic tactical disagreement plaguing the jam session. You overhear someone making mention of... a huge, gay hope bubble? That can’t be right, but you didn’t catch who said it. A flamboyant pink spell? Yeah, this conversation is off the rails now.</p>
    <p>At the precise moment you believe the meeting has outlasted its usefulness, Jake does you the favor of effectively pounding the gavel for adjournment by rocking back a bit too far on your lawn pogo and launching himself over the top of the ride on the next bounce. He face-plants right into the dirt.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="jake">JAKE: Jeepers!</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dirk goes to help your yard clean the Jake off its dirt. Jade follows, to help out. It seems she wants to chat with Jake, considering it’s the first time they’ve met, from her perspective. Some eruptions of chatter can be heard from other members of the group. It’s easy to forget, since the reunion between your friends and all your young relatives happened so long ago from your point of view, but this is all quite novel to everyone here. They’ve hardly had a moment to process it, since your plan to drag them all off to fight Lord English has understandably stolen the thunder of an otherwise poignant homecoming. Poor kids, you think.</p>
    <p>You decide to give the teens some space to work through their shit before you take off to save the universe. You end up wandering all the way around to the other side of your house, and back, until you reach a window facing the neighbor’s fence. You can see straight into your dad’s study from here. You go still. Feet rooted to the ground, heart hammering in your ribs. Your dad’s sitting right there, smoking his pipe and operating his professional-looking, boring, gray PDA. He’s got the kitchen timer set up on his desk, and you can hear the notes of his favorite fatherly jazz album filtering out through the window, which is open only an inch.</p>
    <p>The sun is hitting the glass in such a way that you can’t see his face.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; This is probably the last time you’ll ever have the chance to talk to him...  </p>
    <p class="no-indent">The urge is overwhelming. But you can’t, and not just because your feet won’t move and your throat is closing up. It’s just that... it would be a really bad idea to bother him. It would totally freak him out, to have an adult version of his son show up out of the blue and knock on his window like a creep. He probably wouldn’t even recognize you.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Fair enough. It’s time to go, John.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">You return to the backyard. Your teen friends have split off into genetically segmented groups: Roxy and Rose sitting in the grass, Jade and your shared ecto-parents laughing together by the Green Slime pogo, and the Striders leaning against the farthest fence, with a tense foot and a half of space between them. It’s heartwarming. But something doesn’t feel right about it to you, possibly for selfish reasons. It’s the selfishness of your own perspective, of wanting the memories you had of the reunion between all these people to be the most notable and legitimate manifestation of this event. To see the moment echo, or play out all over again, to overhear the heartfelt confessions repeat themselves... It feels cheap. To you, that is. To the man who lived through it all before and selfishly doesn’t want to have the memory tarnished with a tawdry reprisal, an exhibition of counterfeit emotional catharsis among pale shadows of those you care about most in the world.</p>
    <p>You wonder. Do you see these teen versions of your friends as “real”? Are you treating them, at Rose’s behest, as simple puppets? Doing your part to insist they fill friend-shaped recesses in an essential plan to stabilize all else that can be considered important, a distinction no longer applying to them? Do you care at all about whatever fate it may be that you are sentencing these children to? Are you becoming as complicit in the fatalistic evils of Paradox Space as Lord English himself? Are you becoming a monster, John Egbert?</p>
    <p>You can’t bear to watch them bond any further than this. Nor can you tolerate another moment of your self-incriminating reverie. You wait one more minute before breaking it up, but not a second longer.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Rose gets up from the grass, elegant as a fold in paper, and brushes down her skirt. She tilts her head at you, looking very much like your Rose did when she saw you off that morning. It’s obvious that she’s trying very hard to hide her apprehension. </p>

    <p class="no-indent">Only Jade says yes enthusiastically. Everyone else takes a deep breath and looks around at each other. Hands are taken, some tentatively, some firmly.

Dirk has to stick a finger in one ear to hear what Rose is saying over the cacophony of boos and buckets being lobbed toward center stage. He considers it all pretty fucking annoying, so he flips off the crowd and jumps the ropes. Always a good idea to abscond from the stadium before the customary show-end riot hits full swing.</p>
    <p>The last standing robot scoops up Jake’s unconscious body and cradles him to its chest before blasting off through the roof.</p>
    <p>On the other end of the phone, Rose lets him know what’s up.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s not so much “what is up” as “what is down,” the answer to which is, proverbially: Me. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I mean that both physically and philosophically by the way.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: You’re down philosophically?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I’m not sure what that actually means.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: What doesn’t it mean, Dirk.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Glad to see that my genetic predisposition for melodrama is still alive and well in my slime-progeny even after all these years.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Please don’t interrupt. This is important, and I’ll need all the energy I can spare to sustain even a heavily monologic transmission of the relevant facts.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I see. Forgive my brief, casual interjection into the conversation you initiated. Please continue.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Thank you.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Anyway, the matter at hand is my “condition,” with which you’re already familiar.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I’ve struggled to devise the right way of telling you without causing undue alarm, which would unquestionably trigger the overbearing tendency of yours to “solve the problem” for me, which is not the kind of circumstance my constitution can withstand these days. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I can barely lift a wrist to my forehead to telegraph my infirmity, of late. Your bullshit is precisely the thousand-pound feather that could knock me clean through my apartment’s plate glass window.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: This is troubling to hear, of course. But rest assured, I’m taking solace in the fact that your infirmity doesn’t seem to have spread to your vocal cords yet.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: See, Dirk? This is exactly the shit I don’t need from you on this day.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Sorry.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: The bottom line is this.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I am ascending, and it is terrible.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Rose adjusts her position on the couch with the body language of one about to dive into the latest gossip about a mutual friend. The mutual in this case: her tortured psyche.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Years of refining my Seer of Light powers have cursed me with what is approaching near infinite prescience. Dwelling in this idyllic post-canon realm has worn down the barriers separating my primary consciousness from the memories and experiences of all my doomed alternate selves, which were forgotten and discarded over the due course of our journey.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: As I approach the realization of my Ultimate Self, I cannot stop the extant knowledge from seeping in. I am plagued by near constant visions from the less fortunate versions of myself, as well as a broadening view of the metatextual nature of our existence.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Day by day I get closer to comprehending the full picture of the narrative.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: However, I am still trapped in this limited body. There is only so much strain that my very finite synapses can take.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It drains all of my energy to keep my consciousness focused on relevant events, but even then I am losing my ability to discern what is and is not canonically relevant, let alone what is also true or essential.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: And all of this is making me incredibly fucking sick.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Oh. Is that all?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: ... </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Well, in the spirit of full disclosure,</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Same.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Rose is silent on the line for a few moments. Dirk can hear how labored her breathing is, how thin it is. She snorts out a quick, humorless laugh.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Really?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: That’s the hottest take you can manage?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Of course not. They haven’t built the vessel yet that can withstand the temperatures of atmospheric entry into one of my hotter takes, let alone the hottest.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: It wasn’t a take. It was an empathetic admission toward my pitiable, similarly omniscience-stricken offspring.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: We are suffering from the same condition, Rose.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She allows several rare conversational beats to pass in silence between them, to process the admission.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: We are?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Sure.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It doesn’t sound to me like you’re suffering much at all.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Well, I’m not.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I guess I used the wrong phrase. You are suffering from it. I am adapting to it. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: I already have, really.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: When were you going to tell me this?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: When you were ready.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: So you have determined that I’m ready to receive this rather critical piece of information now, of all times?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: What distinguishes the present from the other moments you could have mentioned it?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Were you waiting for the effects of my condition to become so unendurable that I finally felt the need to explain what was happening to me in full?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Were you, in essence, waiting for a cry for help?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Wow. Well, when you put it that way, it makes me sound like kind of a dick.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: But I guess it isn’t far from the truth, either. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Unbelievable.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Look, it’s not something you just spring on people that frivolously.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: “Hey folks, just so you know, the boundaries of my awareness are coming apart, and now I know almost everything, about everyone, everywhere.”</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: “Also, the process should be tearing my body apart, but actually I’m handling it quite well. Thanks for the concern though.”</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: “Anyway, just thought I’d keep y’all fuckin’ abreast. On my incomprehensible brain and all. Peace.”</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Fine. You’re a cagey guy. This isn’t breaking news.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I’m not pissed at you, I’m just...  </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: So confused. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Why aren’t you suffering the same effects as me?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: There will be time to explain all this. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Despite whatever appearance of callousness I’ve maintained in withholding this information from you, I actually do have your best interests in mind. I don’t want to wear you out on this call. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: There’s so much more to say, but it can wait.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: For now, I’ll just mention that I’ve been alert to your problem for some time, and I’ve been devising a solution which should permanently remedy it without compromising the boon of your expanding consciousness.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: You have?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: What is it?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Would love to tell you, but I’ve got some work to do. Why don’t you stop by my studio later so we can hash this shit out in person. </p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Right now, you should get some rest.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Actually, I’m feeling oddly invigorated suddenly. I think I’m good for more exposition, if you are.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Can’t say I’m surprised. But no.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Have I caught you at a bad time?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Nah, but there is an election coming up, and my work as a political operative is going to be absolutely essential for the fate of humanity.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I see. Wheels within wheels, I assume?</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: There are always wheels. Wheels are everywhere.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: They aren’t my wheels or yours. The wheels don’t have owners or designers, but they do have caretakers.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: They won’t keep turning on their own without someone to grease the mechanism.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: What a burden it must be, to recognize oneself as the sole machinist of reality itself.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: It’s a curse, but somebody’s gotta do it.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Save your strength. Come to my studio when you’re feeling up to it.</p>
    <p class="dirk">DIRK: Goodbye. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Dirk hangs up without waiting for a reply. He cracks his neck and tips down his shades so that he can appreciate the full brunt of the sunset: purple and orange, blending brilliantly on the horizon.</p>
    <p>She’s right about him, he thinks. While his ecto-daughter views herself as having a somewhat deft artistic hand that lends itself naturally to a gentle push-and-pull style of influence, Dirk knows his methods are mechanical, like those of an engineer. There is nothing adaptive or interpretive about his method. Every piece has a purpose, a slot, an interlocking mechanism that is functionally pointless without the whole. </p>
    <p>Dirk, satisfied with this moment of particularly astute self-reflection, rocks back on his heels and launches himself into the sky.</p></div>

    <p class="Command">&gt; Look down.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">All the way down beneath you there is a light source. Gray, focused—like a spotlight, except that it’s folded over the curvature of the space beneath it. At the center of it stands teenage Lord English, all decked out in his ostentatious god tier jammies. Gamzee’s there too, for some unfathomably stupid reason. There’s a robot bunny chilling out on top of a chest, lookin’ cool and kicking its cute little bunny legs back and forth. You hope that neither of these unexpected dramatis personae will play a role in the coming battle, because it wouldn’t feel right whaling on either of them at this point.</p>
    <p>Lord English is holding something that looks like... Lil Cal? It’s definitely Lil Cal, and Lord English is definitely waltzing around with it in his little spotlight in the middle of the nowhere, swinging the puppet around by both its floppy arms. Well, rather, he <em>was</em> waltzing around. He stopped the moment you looked at him.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">The young Lord’s face begins to distort. The unhinging of his jaw reverberates in the empty space. He laughs through the remainder of his nefarious soliloquy, which he has possibly prepared in advance for this moment.</p>

You probably also wouldn’t be rendered that much additionally agog if you were told it didn’t happen precisely as conveyed by the young Lord’s expertly produced claymation theater. </p>
    <p>Would it be that surprising if the first four heroes weren’t immediately captured in the juju, as the dark web swan song broadcast through bogus Vine videos originally depicted? Probably not. Would it raise any eyebrows if the action turned out to be a bit sloppier than that? A bloody nose here. A stray wedgie there. Someone trips on a cape. Loud eruptions of the word “Ow.” Petulant insults, smack talk, crude gestures, and stray honks from the sidelines. Would it rock anyone’s world to discover the stop-motion feature did not treat this battle royale with the utmost fidelity?</p>
    <p>No one who witnessed the spectacle online would react to these discrepancies with much surprise. But you are not such a witness. You are still John Egbert, and you had no idea what sort of raucous teen pandemonium to expect when you zapped into the lair of your nemesis to throw down. Which is why you were completely blindsided when, upon feeling overwhelmed by the melee, Caliborn sprung his gambit on you and your three best friends to even the odds. </p>
    <p>He opened his little red chest, and out came his white, house-shaped juju, levitating there, threatening to behave as the weapon many treasure hunters throughout history have described it to be. Upon a second look, it’s not quite white though. It’s colorless, null. A house-shaped hole in your confining reality. A hole that insists on being filled.</p>
    <p>You tried to resist its overwhelming pull, but to no avail. The force is too strong. Not like the sucking from the vacuum of space, or the tug from a gravitational singularity. It was more overpowering than any force in nature. Almost... metatextual. Not negating your powers, your strength to resist, so much as it seemed to overwrite them.</p>
    <p>The juju sucked you, Rose, Dave, and Jade into its void at the speed of eternity squashed down to a half second. You landed in the abstract prison it contains face-first, alone, and with a force that made you flip over a few times and skid along by the flat of your chin. You groped for your glasses instinctively, finding them in two cracked halves. You cradled their remains as you looked up.</p>
    <p>The blurry, distorted face of your laughing nemesis was the last thing you saw before the chest door slammed shut and plunged you into textual obsolescence.</p>
    <p>And here, you are now stuck. You will not emerge from this holding cell, from an outside perspective, for quadrillions of years. It is not long at all until you begin to wish you had brought something to read.</p></div>

Everything else rises up from that like steam: a trembling thread that cuts through space in jagged lines, splintering the void into razor-sharp shards of putrefying leptons and quarks popping apart like raw eggs in a microwave. It’s coming undone at a subatomic level, from the bottom up, from the inside out. From the top down it looks like the eye of a storm—a black hole so supermassive that it spans the width of eternity. It turns infinity into something as thin and fragile as cellophane; shreds it of its dimensions, a piece of paper pinched together at either end, a hole poked through it. </p>
    <p>At the center of that hole the edges can be heard fraying. Pandemonium, as continuity buckles in the middle and the two ends come smashing together. Around the hole, ghosts scream. They claw at the dying borders of their dreams with fingernail-chipping desperation. They whip together like the wind, trailing the mutilated streaks of their hypothetical futures with them. It’s a multifractal neon cyclone of primordial conclusion. A churning blender of hyperfinal, catastrophically terminal, overwhelmingly permanent double-death. The screaming distorts and plunges low as it gets closer to the cavity.</p>
    <p>At the center, that distortion turns into an eerie music. That’s where the cacophony ends—the shattering, the screaming, the squelching, the sounds of elemental particles being torn apart like string cheese shoved through a meat grinder, then dumped down a strangely melodious garbage disposal. It all returns to the same tonic dominant, matching pitch and tone, ironing out the rebellious flats and sharps until the discordance becomes exquisite. A subharmonic symphony that can only be heard in the bones. At the <em>dead center</em> of the event, it is extremely quiet. A silence made of all the suffering that limitless sempiternity can hold, bleeding together until the prism turns to obsidian. It’s too vast to comprehend, too black to behold without closing your eyes. Retreating to the back of your own eyelids is to seek the comfort of a familiar darkness. It is to reject an absolute tenebrosity so perfectly alien, it threatens to rip the humanity right through your eye sockets.</p>
    <p>This is the end of everything. This is the end of Paradox Space. You... </p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Wake up.</p>

Absolutely nothing of note has ever happened here in the entire history of the planet, which you would know, because you created it.</p>
    <p>Beside your pillow, your phone is vibrating. Rose is calling. The screen of your phone reads 9:30 a.m. April 13, and also the number forty-six, which is how many text messages your friend left you while you were sleeping. A bit excessive, even for her.</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: what’s going to happen? should we be worried?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It doesn’t technically pertain to the future. Well, not our future. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: My abilities have broadened considerably beyond their previous horizon. They shed light on many unseen events. Past, present, future, in realities and frames of reference that have no intersection with ours at all.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It seems to be an unfortunate side effect of god tier abilities. They can advance at a rate beyond one’s physical ability to keep up with.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Fortunately it doesn’t seem to be happening to anyone other than me. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: yeah, can’t say i’ve noticed anything like that.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: or improvement in my powers for that matter.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s not about gaining additional power, so much as the gradual dissolving of the boundaries between your own awareness and that of your many doomed selves who perished in other timelines. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s a slow and apparently rather uncomfortable accretion of knowledge. Perhaps I’m the only one to notice any change, since my aspect explicitly relates to knowledge. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i guess that all makes sense.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: so what are these visions showing you?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Many things. They’re quite disjointed, and sometimes hard to rearrange into coherence. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But in totality, I have pieced together a greater understanding of our present situation and all the events that led us here.</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: what is it about our situation that you wanted to tell me?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: is it bad?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Good and bad are words that don’t mean anything, beyond a certain threshold of mortal consideration.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: There’s a different scale I’ve come to understand. Another dichotomy that’s less... emotional, I guess?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Consider, instead of the word “good,” using the word “essential.”</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: And what exists at the opposite polarity from essential is... </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Something that is best not to contemplate.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: what are you talking about?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: this sounds fucked up.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes, that sounds like a reaction you would definitely have to the things I’m telling you.</p>

    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: The green sun is gone.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: what??</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It has been destroyed. At least, from the current frame of reference it has.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It still existed, and therefore in a way that’s hard to explain, currently exists, over a nearly infinite span of time, presiding over the birth and death of countless universes.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But this universe, our universe, is not one of them.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: you saw this in a vision?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: No. Jade told me.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: she did?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: how does she know?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: She can’t draw from its power anymore. She no longer has the ability of a First Guardian.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It has been this way for several years. I suspect she has kept this fact on the downlow, however.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: that’s... </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: surprising, i guess?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: or maybe not. i dunno, it’s not like she tells me a whole lot these days.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s also not like she’s had any particular need to unleash the full fury of the green sun, not while she’s been gallivanting around with Dave and Karkat under whatever perplexing social arrangement they have settled on.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Anyway, her account of the sun’s destruction syncs up with the data supplied by my visions. I have no doubt it’s gone.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: how did that happen?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It doesn’t matter much, for our purposes.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: There was a cataclysmic event. A suicide strike by a very powerful being. Much like the one Dave and I attempted, once upon a time.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But it turned out the explosive force we released was only a catalyst. A causal gesture. What was needed to destroy the sun was a consumptive assault.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: consumptive?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: The entire sun was swallowed by a supermassive black hole. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I digress though. </p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">You press your eyes shut, just for a moment. Behind them you see <em>a black hole so supermassive that it spans the width of eternity.</em></p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: fine?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Of course everything is fine here.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: We’re outside of canon now.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: yeah, i know. what does that actually MEAN though?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: are you saying this isn’t really happening?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Of course it’s happening. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Just because certain events take place outside of canon, it doesn’t mean those events are non-canon.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: oh.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: In other words, there is an important distinction between events which can be considered to occur inside canon, outside canon, and those which are not canon at all.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: The day we went through that door and claimed our reward, we passed a threshold between continua marked by differing degrees of relevance, truth, and essentiality. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Those are the three pillars of canon.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: what?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Rose shoots you an irritated look. You know what that look means. It’s reserved for the sort of bozo who just said “what” once too often. </p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Any event said to take place inside canon will have nonzero values of relevance and essentiality, while maintaining an absolute foundation in truth, by definition.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Whereas events outside canon have diminished values of relevance and essentiality. Or, for the most part, can be considered neither relevant nor essential at all. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But such events can’t be said to be untrue either. Instead, it’s better to regard their truth value as highly conditional. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Are you still following?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Say “oh, yeah. totally.”</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="john">JOHN: oh, yeah. totally.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: So to be clear, everything that’s taken place here on Earth C since we exited canon can be considered completely irrelevant, and for the most part, absolutely inessential. Yet none of it can be called untrue. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: At least, up until precisely today. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: ok.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: then what does non-canon mean?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Events that are formally non-canon have no truth whatsoever, by definition. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: They may have relevance and essentiality values that are nonzero, or even quite high, but only as projections along an imaginary axis, resulting from highly subjective frames of reference.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But due to those events having no truth, and thus carrying no real weight, the other properties are basically rendered meaningless.</p>

    <p class="rose">ROSE: John?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Are you okay? Your pupils have gone quite wide, thereby facilitating the appearance that your mind has just been blown.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: sorry, i’m just trying to wrap my head around this.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: You of all people really should have a good intuitive grasp over these concepts already. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: You’re the one with the retcon powers, after all.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i know!</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: like, i mostly get it. i think.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i just wouldn’t have thought to put all of this in such a jargony way.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Sorry. That’s kind of what I do.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: it’s fine. i’m just a bit rusty is all. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: it feels like it’s been so long since i did, or even thought about... anything that mattered at all.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes, the longer we live outside of canon, the more tenuous our relationship with canon becomes.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Hence the urgency.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: then what’s going to happen if we keep dragging our feet?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I mentioned that events outside canon have a truth value that tends to be conditional, remember?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: um.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Well, I did. But let me put it another way.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: As long as we live outside canon, everything that happens will technically be “real,” but only conditionally. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: There are certain crucial events inside canon which must happen in order to continue to prop up the legitimacy of events here on Earth C. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: And you specifically, John, have a responsibility to make sure those events take place.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: and i take it that means going back and killing lord english?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Yes.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: His defeat is the keystone to this entire continuity. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Much like his life, in some sick way, governed the overall design of the bridge which that keystone was holding up.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But without it, all of this falls apart. Every thing we’ve been through, in a way that’s impossible for a single mind to fully comprehend, becomes retroactively discredited. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: so... reality will be destroyed, or something?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: hasn’t that already sort of happened?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: i mean, when all the black space started cracking?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: No, this consequence isn’t physical, or even a disruption of the timeline. It’s more of a conceptual unraveling.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: If you miss the chance to authenticate canon events, something will take place that’s a bit difficult to describe, but I’ve encountered a term for it.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s called “dissipation.”</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Like, a notional fading. As if something, somewhere, is undergoing a process of “forgetting,” and we are what is being forgotten.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: All ideas, people and their full potentialities, possible outcomes and their specific unfolding, all these things live inside conscious frameworks. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: The further removed we get from authentication of canon events, the less relevant they become, and they slowly fade from the conscious frameworks which kept them stable.</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: ok, i guess we don’t want THAT to happen.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: or... unhappen. whatever.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: so i just retcon-poof back to english and start like...</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: brawling with the dude?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Don’t be ridiculous. You wouldn’t last a second.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: You’ll need a team.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Also, you don’t want to just dive headlong into a battle with his hulking adult form. That would be tactically foolish, and furthermore, would skip over some very important steps needed to authenticate canon.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: like what?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I mentioned that English’s defeat was the keystone to the continuity. But this is an oversimplification.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: yikes. well, we sure as fuck wouldn’t want to simplify anything.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: John, please don’t be a bitch. I’m unwell, remember?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: sorry.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: The true keystone, which is a necessary component of his defeat, is the juju.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: The house-shaped object you stuck your hand in to gain your retcon powers.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: oh yeah.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: While empty, it resembles a gap. Like a hole in canon, whose only purpose is to be filled.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: In serving that purpose, it grants one with the radical canon-altering powers that would be needed to fill it.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Once filled, it becomes solid. No longer a gap, but a serviceable, load-bearing wedge in our continuity.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Like a keystone.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: And once delivered to English and directed his way, it empties itself again, releasing its narrative-bridging payload. It functions as a weapon, and in some manner will bring about his demise.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: in some manner?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It’s a complicated artifact. As old and unfathomable as anything else in Paradox Space, like the green sun, or English himself. Don’t worry about it for now.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: The important thing is that, in the due course of your travels, you end up loading and unloading this weapon.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: how am i going to do that?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Once you set things in motion, it should just happen naturally through the narrative momentum of your journey. I’m really just warning you about it, rather than instructing you.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: ok. thanks??</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: You’re welcome.</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: are you sure you’re actually up for a fight though? no offense, but you’re looking a little worse for the wear.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I’m not going.</p>

    <p class="rose">ROSE: John, this is the victory state. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: what the hell does that even mean.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: When we went through the door, and passed beyond the threshold of canon, we effectively retired from bearing any responsibility for influencing canon events. We’ve all been sort of decommissioned as active players on the cosmic stage, with severely diminished relevance attributes. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: All of us except for you, of course, since you’ve retained your retcon abilities.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: ok, i get that. kind of. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: but... couldn’t you all just come along anyway?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: We could. But it wouldn’t serve any purpose.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It wouldn’t plug up the remaining dark spots in canon. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: You’ll need a group of active players. Those still stuck inside the stream of canonic karma.</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: who?</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Nothing too extravagant. Just different versions of us. </p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: Younger versions, from a particularly dysfunctional impasse in our journey.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I can point out the exact moment in canon you should be disrupting, and how you should disrupt it.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: In fact, I’ve already written it down to spare you the trouble of remembering.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">Rose leads you back inside and retrieves a letter from her desk. She hands it over, still typing one-handed on her phone. She sits down and you read the letter.</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: it’s just weird to think about revisiting this. it seems like an eternity. like... we were all completely different people back then.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I assure you we are all still fundamentally the same bunch of losers.</p>

    <p class="no-indent">You exhale and turn the paper over in your hands. The other side is blank.

    <p class="john">JOHN: i mean, aside from the part where we all have to fight an invincible monster.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: He isn’t entirely invincible. He will be vulnerable to Dave’s weapon. I believe other gambits should present themselves as well.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: I don’t think it would serve the mission well for me to tell you exactly how it will go.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: But at least I can offer this bit of encouragement.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: If you follow my instructions, English will be defeated.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: It is an absolutely essential outcome.</p>
    <p class="rose">ROSE: And essential, if you’ll remember, is the word we should be using instead of good.</p>

    <p class="john">JOHN: that dude sucks. </p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: he was taunting me a while back. </p>

    <p class="no-indent">Her eyes are closed and her hands are folded in her lap. She’s not asleep, but she looks wasted—like all the life in her has been sucked out through a straw. Like she’s insubstantial. When you were kids you always thought that Rose Lalonde had all the answers, that she could fix any problem with a wall of text and a witty rejoinder. You guess that much about her hasn’t changed. She’s still trying to solve the problems you all left behind. You can’t believe how sick she looks. How did this happen to her?</p>

For whatever faults this paradise you created might have, you sure don’t hear many complaints about the weather. You’re sitting with Roxy and Calliope on a giant, chessboard-pattern tablecloth. It’s a nice touch, you think. But if you spent any time shopping in the Carapace Kingdom, you’d know most things you can buy are chess themed. </p>
    <p>Friendly carapacians go about their day around you, passing through the park with their eyes politely averted as they pretend not to notice that three celebrities are having lunch in the grass nearby. It’s extra polite of them, because you and Roxy are having a very personal conversation. </p>

    <p class="no-indent">You start dwelling on it immediately, looking probably quite conspicuous with how quickly you whipped your gaze away. But seriously, what <em>is</em> up with their relationship? Is it romantic? Platonic? Can cherubs even have a romantic relationship? Are they even <em>interested</em> in it, like, on a fundamental level? Do their brains and hearts even work that way? Questions like this used to keep you awake at night.</p>
    <p>You look at them, at where Roxy’s fingers are entwined with Calliope’s green claws. Calliope is still wearing the Ring of Life. The same one you obtained in a ludicrous adventure through the afterlife, and then re-obtained in a ludicrous adventure through canon when it was stolen from you. It’s the same one that allowed Calliope to stop being dead in the first place, and to come live with your friends here on your beautifully renovated home planet. And it’s the same one you gave Roxy all those years ago, to fulfill a promise made to a very special new friend.</p>
    <p>At the time, the gesture felt so important. It felt more meaningful than any gift you’d ever given. Like there was some grand emotional gravitas about it that signified something deeper than... than what it turned out to be. </p>
    <p>You have since concluded you were just imagining things. Ascribing symbolic meaning to gestures that they simply didn’t carry, like the dumb kid you were.</p>

    <p>You and all your friends have dispositions affected by your classes and aspects. You think you know what that means in your case. But what about her? You can only speculate. Void is a place where things sink and disappear. Where they linger forever, but cease to exist. You aren’t actually sure if your feelings for Roxy ever really faded, or if they just grew numb with time and distance. Is it the same for her?</p>
    <p>You search your soul for the answer, but come up empty. The truth is, you suspect her mental interior is unfathomable. In fact, you feel sure of it. </p>

    <p class="no-indent">You try, but you can’t, because you weren’t really prepared for it. You didn’t think it was a choice at all until this very second. You think back to the way Rose looked at you before she went to bed. What has she told Roxy that she didn’t tell you? The chill tightens around your throat and turns into fear. </p>
    <p>No, not fear. The feeling is worse than that. It’s <em>regret</em>. </p>
    <p>You wasted your time here on this idyllic restoration of Earth. Why did you spend so much time alone? Moping around the house mourning your dead father, who probably would have wanted you to get more enjoyment out of your teen years, as well as your unusually early retirement. There’s so much you could have done. You could have even reached out to Roxy again; maybe she was waiting for you to do that. Maybe your withdrawal hurt her. Maybe she was heartbroken, just like you kind of feel right now. You study her perfectly stoic face and conclude nothing from it. Her expression reminds you of how Dave used to look, when you first met for real, before years of living with Karkat softened him up. Impenetrable cool. </p>
    <p>It’s too late to figure any of this out now. You fucked it up already.</p>
    <p>Unless, of course, you choose to stay.</p>
    <p>Upon further examination, you realize that Roxy’s stoicism isn’t cold. There’s concern there. She is displaying restraint, keeping quiet while you make up your mind. You’re sweating, you realize. Cold sweat. Even worse than the anime nightmare sweat you woke up soaked in this morning.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: john u ok?</p>
    <p class="john">JOHN: ... </p>
    <p class="roxy">ROXY: looked like you were gonna pass out there for a second</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Suddenly, Calliope bolts upright.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: of coUrse! what was i thinking.</p>
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: this decision is far too important to be made on an empty stomach.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">She fetches the picnic basket, which naturally has been sitting there on the tablecloth since the moment you arrived.</p>
    <div class="chat type-rg type-hs-small--md">
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: here, before yoU choose which path yoU’re going to take, yoU shoUld decide what yoU’d like to eat!</p>
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: i have packed a wide variety of provisions. easily enoUgh to satisfy even the most ravenoUs picnic-goer’s appetite.</p>
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: behold, an array of savory delights for the carnally inclined. </p>
    <p class="calliope">CALLIOPE: or perhaps something for yoUr sweet tooth, if a lUst for treats is what stokes yoUr desire?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="no-indent">Calliope produces two dishes from the basket and begins gingerly unwrapping them. The unwrapping is so ginger, in fact, that there’s something almost dramatic about it. Like the opening theme to that boring sci-fi movie with the monolith and the bone-throwing monkeys should be playing as she peels away the cheesecloth. </p>
    <p>On one plate is a pile of meat: rare, almost bleeding cuts from animals you can’t identify. The other plate holds a generous heap of colorful, exotic-looking candy. You scoot to the side and peek into the basket to see if there’s anything else. There’s a book in there, but no more food. This is all there is.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; Contemplate your lunch.</p>
    <p class="no-indent">You put a finger to your lips and focus on the food with great intensity. You stop fretting about choices, and heartbreak, and eternity, and Lord English. Your entire world narrows to a single point of light as you are utterly consumed by the overbearing decision about which of these absurd meals to have for lunch.</p>
    <p class="Command">&gt; MEAT or CANDY?</p>
    <p class="no-indent">Meat or candy. The two possibilities pinball around your skull. Meat or candy. It’s a tough choice. On any other day you might be inclined to simply follow the whims of your cravings, but no clear victor surges to the forefront of your mind.</p>
    <p>Either option offers a tempting means of sustenance. You know the meat will be rich and filling, and if you’re being honest with yourself, you haven’t had the most robust diet as of late. You didn’t even have breakfast. It’s probably a good idea to eat something resembling a real meal for once.</p>
    <p>But you’re no stranger to Calliope’s tastes, as far as carnivorous comestibles are concerned. You know every cut on that plate is rare to the core. It’ll fill your mouth to bursting with juice, lie heavy on your stomach for hours to come as your body works to break down all the nutritious protein and fat.</p>
    <p>It might be tough to chew. It might be even tougher to swallow.</p>
    <p>Maybe the candy is the better choice for a picnic like this. Something that’ll go down easy and fill you with bright energy as you pass the time with your friends. You know you need to just let go sometimes, and stop worrying so much about what other people expect of you. Or even what <em>you</em> expect of you. It’s not a bad thing to enjoy yourself just for the sake of pleasure.</p>
    <p>But eat too much and all that sweetness could make you sick.</p>
    <p>Roxy and Calliope glance at each other in confusion as you deliberate over what to eat. You suppose it’s taking you a while to choose, but each dish is appealing enough in certain ways. Each has its potential dietary drawbacks. You don’t want to make a decision you can’t stomach.</p>
    <p>Meat or candy, John. Meat or candy?</p>
    <p>You release your breath when you realize you’ve been holding it. You’re being ridiculous. What’s the sense of fussing over lunch? In the end, it really doesn’t matter. Whatever you choose, it’ll all be flushed down the toilet tomorrow.</p>
    <p>Just go with your gut. Don’t sweat the small stuff. There are much more important things out there to fuck yourself up over.</p></div>
