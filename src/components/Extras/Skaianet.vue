                        At the beginning of 2019, the <a href="http://skaianetsystems.com">Skaianet Systems</a> website launched, containing multiple hidden files within its source HTML.
                        Among <a href="assets://archive/skaianet/CRITICAL_ASSETS/index.html">other files</a>, there were 36 text documents outlining certain events that took place during Her Imperious Condescension's rise to power in universe B2.
                      </p><p>
                        <strong>The following has been quoted directly from <a href="https://mspaintadventures.fandom.com/wiki/Skaianet_Systems_Incorporated#Criticism_and_apology">The MSPA Wiki</a>:</strong>
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Following the initial release of the hidden "history" content found within the site's files, some portions of its readership expressed severe concerns about segments of its content. In particular, the interactions between Adolf Hitler and Albert Einstein, and some of the more sexual interludes, were found to be carelessly offensive or inflammatory. The treatment of the Holocaust in particular was criticised for being offhandedly antisemitic.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The hidden content was removed shortly after the release of the Skaianet Systems website, however this did not stem its spread or the spread of the criticism. Between January 2–5, an apology message written presumably by Andrew Hussie was present on the Skaianet Systems homepage, reflecting on the insensitivity of aspects of the writing, and apologizing for releasing work that was carelessly drafted and inflammatory.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The apology message reads:

                          Originally there was some backstory content hidden in some cursed tags in this site code. I came up with the concepts years ago for internal purposes, not originally intended for public consumption. I thought some might find it interesting if the material were leaked in the site code in an obscure way. I think it has proven to be neither obscure as imagined, nor all that rewarding to read. The subject matter was inflammatory in careless ways, and the negative reactions to it are legitimate and should have been expected. A drafting process can be messy and can result in some ill-advised nonsense which often should not see the light of day. Letting a bunch of rough draft text files be deployed in this way was not a well considered move. Obviously this material has hurt a lot of people. Which isn't what I was going for, and didn't anticipate, but certainly should have. As far as the intentions behind it, I'm sure I believed it would be read as condemnation through satire, but instead it came off as excessively irreverent and disrespectful of a sensitive topic (to be clear, the main topic relates to antisemitism, which of course is not an issue that should be handled frivolously). After receiving criticism it's obvious to me where I'd been mistaken, and why no one could have possibly read it the way it was intended. I know this content was bad, I regret putting it in a place where people would discover it, and I regret that it was drafted in the first place.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I acknowledge that there are certain subjects which demand an exceptional level of care, and that I have been inexcusably thoughtless in handling this. I understand that there should be a certain standard of consideration and review for the content that is presented to an audience, and in forgoing that consideration there have been serious consequences for those people whom this issue directly affects. This could have been easily avoided had I sought a more careful review before it was posted to ensure that what I actually wanted to convey was being properly conveyed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          I am sorry that this lapse of judgment has been hurtful to so many people. I cannot undo the damage that this has caused, but I can promise that I am aware of the gravity of this mistake and that, going forward, I will be more mindful of the serious impact careless decisions have on those they hurt.

            <p>Monsters in the yard. Monsters in the house. Monsters in the hall, beating on your door. Your brother's trapped in his treehouse, so he’s not gonna be much help. You're going to have to get yourself out of this. But where did they come from? How are you supposed to deal with this? Well, certainly not by cowering in your room. That's for, uh, cowards.</p>

            <p>First things first. You need to open the door.</p>

            <p>HIVESWAP is a four-part series set in Andrew Hussie’s Homestuck universe, with a companion series, <em>Hauntswitch</em>, to follow. Continue your save from chapter to chapter, then from game to game, to carry your story, choices, friendships and frenemies across them all--then do it again! Once released, HIVESWAP and <em>Hauntswitch</em> will be playable in either order. Haven’t read Homestuck? That’s fine! This game is set in 1994! Homestuck hasn’t even been invented yet!</p>

            <p>Also see the <a href='http://hs.hiveswap.com/ezodiac/index.php'>Extended Zodiac</a>, an official personality quiz that assigns you a zodiac symbol based on your quiz answers and the Act 2 character preview <a href='http://hs.hiveswap.com/trollcall/'>Troll Call</a>, released as promotional material for the Hiveswap games.</p>

            <p>Homestuck^2: Beyond Canon is an official continuation of the cult-classic webcomic Homestuck and a follow-up to The Homestuck Epilogues, dropped as a major event in April of 2019.</p>
            <p>Homestuck 2: Beyond Canon takes a combination of Andrew Hussie's original writing and plot outlines and concepts and joins him with a team of new, diverse voices to expand the compelling narratives of Homestuck's most (and least) beloved characters.</p>
