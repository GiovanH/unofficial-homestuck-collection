    <pre><strong>5. - the rose rap (feat. von fawn as rose)
    </strong>

    <strong>roserap:

    </strong>

    strider let me break it down like this for you

    there once was a violet femme fatale
    whose violent violin sung sweet without

    the tables of a boy who turned tricks and treats
    like icy halloween breeze/ so fresh were his beats


    but alone they were weak
    no revolution
    together - overtime
    there was an evolution

    they met on the net and there was a fusion
    like danimals yogurt breakfast frusion


    hearts
    and minds
    and souls
    and hearts
    they loved each other you bag of farts

    they promised to be each others baby mommy daddy babies
    but now theyre both caught in their lies
    their fingers in another persons pies
    guilty of another person's scabies

    <strong>
      <em>
        CHORUS (SUNG):
      </em></strong>

      strider
      heart to heart
      dont treat me like a fool

      you may have played me
      but my heart waylayed me
      i wanna be your baby mommy too



      <strong>daverap:
      </strong>rose i know how you're feeling, i know your emotions
      i want you to know i mirror your devotion
      you dont see this kind of depravity on the serengetti
      whoops there goes gravity, moms spaghetti

      i screwed up, i fucked up, i got screwed and fucked
      im the baby of bad choices and my little legs are tucked
      i wanted to be true, make you a faithful hubby
      but you know i cant do, it's just too much trubby

      we're related rose, thats the problem, not the other
      we cant be baby mommy daddies because your my sis and im you're brother
      i have the feelings your feeling, we share the same idea
      and i know i screwed up and probably caught gonohrrea

      but the truth of it all yo is that.... rose it would have never worked
      and i hope you forgive me
      because... actually... im having this baby now
      i want to say im sorry and that i want to be.......... with you
      and that what i did was wrong
      and you can be its mommy and we can get married
      and not worried about retarded babes

      do you agree

      <strong>roserap:</strong> yes dave.......... oh yes..................... take me away...........
