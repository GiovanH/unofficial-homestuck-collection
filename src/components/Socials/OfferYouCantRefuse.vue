    <h2 style="text-align:left;">An Offer You Can't Refuse</h2>
    <h2 style="text-align:left;">06/11/06</h2>
    <div style="text-align:left;">
      <div style="text-align:left;width:743px;">
        <p style="text-align:left;">
          So I was slammin’ the web 
          pretty hard the other day, cruisin’ some giga-surfs, browsin’ some 
          mad-layouts, or “grooming the hypertext pony”, if you know what I mean. I
          was doing all that good stuff, when this thing appeared on my monitor.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">
          <MediaEmbed url="/archive/social/blogspot/oldblog/olivegarden.jpg" style="height:370px;width:743px;text-align:left;" />
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">This
          amazing offer sent violent tremors of delight down my spinal column. 
          Such was my enthusiasm, I momentarily forgot to wonder why Firefox, a 
          theoretically pop-up blocking browser, failed to block this one. But 
          there was no time to investigate that. Haunting visions of Olive 
          Garden’s legendary bread sticks were gamboling about my brain, 
          paralyzing me with their garlicky aroma, undressing me in preparation of
          the imminent gang rape. Luckily I halted that fantasy before it got 
          ugly, but now it was time to address this “offer”.

        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">There
          are two irresistible things about the offer. One, of course, is the 
          anticipation of cramming vast helpings of already bargain-priced pasta 
          for the dime-savvy family into my face for FREE. The other is the 
          irresistible opportunity to voice my undoubtedly strong opinion on this 
          controversial president to some faceless spam conglomerate. This was 
          very clever of them, because whenever I see an outlet for my strong 
          opinions, no amount of personal willpower will prevent me from 
          broadcasting my viewpoint. It doesn’t matter if doing so will seem 
          inappropriate, inconvenient, or even personally endangering, if there is
          a toilet somewhere for my opinion, I am first in line to flush it down.
          If I were walking through the woods and there were two bear traps on 
          the ground, labeled “Is Bush a good leader? YES: Smash face into left 
          trap, NO: smash face into right” the rusted steel and my mug would be 
        wed without a moment’s pause.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">And
          I especially appreciate this format of opinion solicitation for its 
          simplicity. I no longer need to wage the uphill battle against my brain 
          to come up with insightful justification for my opinion. I don’t even 
          need to say anything! I just need to click a button, and as if offering a
          spammer my strong opinion weren’t gratification enough in itself, my 
          reward is all the soup, salad and bread sticks my digestive system is 
          coerced to handle!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">But
          as the mouse cursor hovers over my opinion of choice, before I click, 
          something unsettling occurs to me. Is there a right or wrong answer? I 
          am properly absorbed in my own political beliefs, and treat them as part
          of my identity as any good American should. They aren’t very well 
          thought through, and comprise a bizarre cocktail of ill-founded self 
          righteousness, irrational biases, and flagrant misinformation, but damn 
          it, they’re MY half-assed opinions. As such, I feel a certain ethical 
          contraction in contemplating “throwing” this poll in favor of free 
          pasta. And even though I’m an honorable man, and by an ass-backwards 
          ideology I think a lot of colonial-looking guys in wigs were skewered by
          imperial bayonets for my right to stubbornly believe in retarded 
          things, it would sure be a damned shame to let that Olive Garden coupon 
          go to waste. I don’t know who is running this “poll”, maybe someone from
          the “Left Coast”, who daily pores through the poll logs while sitting 
          in his Jacuzzi, getting a tan, wrapped in seaweed while hugging a tree 
          and saving a penguin or something, stumbles on my “YES” vote and says 
          “Sorry buddy, you just cost yourself some steaming, succulent chicken 
          alfredo.” Or maybe it’s Karl Rove himself evaluating the answers. He 
          sees my “NO”, hits the delete key and says “Pasta la vista, dipshit!” 
          and chuckles to himself over his wordplay, while stuffing some shrimp 
        primavera into his corpulent face to sort of rub it in.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">In
          the end, I have no way of knowing, and this is as good a reason as any 
          not to compromise my morals. I go with my gut answer, and sure enough, 
        it worked! The free* Olive Garden meals were mine!</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">*with participation in their program and completion of one sponsored offer.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">Feeling
          high on this victory, I went through the various protocols that were 
          asked of me to acquire the coupon, and after installing a variety of 
          exotic, system crippling spyware, and signing up for numerous premium 
          accounts for porn sites, I can expect my coupon in the mail in six to 
        eight weeks.</p>
        <p style="text-align:left;">But
          all this talk of Olive Garden really got me in the mood for it now, so I
          just went out and bought my own damn dinner. It was pretty heavy, and I
          think I filled up on breadsticks too fast. I probably won’t be in the 
        mood for Olive Garden for another year or so.</p>
