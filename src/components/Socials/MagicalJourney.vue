    <h2 style="text-align:left;">Come With Me on a Magical Journey Through
            the Internet!</h2>
    <h2 style="text-align:left;">11/09/07</h2>
    <p style="text-align:left;">I was combing through the markup languosphere the other day.
        You might know the activity as "browsing the web", or maybe by the more common euphemism, "tickling the
        plump hypertext neckwaddle of the corpulent Mayor of Cybersurf City". I had him tittering and giggling,
        rolling about on his back as if a large humanoid bean. I was doing that with a kind of boyish, carefree
        abandon, until I ran into...</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">THIS:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">
        <MediaEmbed url="/archive/social/blogspot/oldblog/journey1.gif" style="height:90px;width:728px;text-align:left;" /></p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">This is the type of thing that has
        become invisible to everyone else, and is quickly dismissed. But not to me. I am sort of like the Dr.
        David Livingstone of the internet. This was enough to have me gathering my safari helmet and my array of
        delicate nettings for ensnaring any precious fauna that might flutter by.
    
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Yes, there may be some other
        intrepid souls out there who would click on such a thing out of pure curiosity. But their pioneering
        spirit dries up there, as no sane person would go any further for the very reasonable fear of
        treacheries ahead. But I am not that person. I'm the type to fling myself headlong through the magical
        wardrobe, and then incinerate the ornate mahogany portal behind me with a Molotov cocktail.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Specifically, I got to asking
        myself the question, "What happens when you click on these spastic bullshit ads for promos of marginal
        value and merit,
        <i style="text-align:left;">and then actually pursue the process to its end?</i>" This is the bottomless
        rabbit hole into which I've sunken my soft, vulnerable torso.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">And I have returned. I have come
        back to chronicle my odyssey for those who would never dream of embarking on one themselves. I do it so
        you don't have to, and because you don't want to. And believe me. You really
        <i style="text-align:left;">don't</i>
        want to.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">But that's because you're all a
        bunch of huge pussies. Personally, I LOVE adventure!</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Ok, let's break it down piece by
        piece, and take a good hard look at this. Rome was not offered for free with the completion of one or
        more promotional offers in a day. I'll start at the beginning of my quest, and walk you through it,
        documenting my emotions, my reasoning, and my actions.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;"><b style="text-align:left;">The
        Pledge.</b></p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">First I am presented with a banner
        of simple design, schizophrenically jittering colors...
        <i style="text-align:left;">and alluring promise</i>. Are my eyes deceiving me? Such luscious bait
        wiggling on this line, and yet such a seemingly simple challenge. Could it really be this easy? Ah, but
        finding out is exactly what will make this adventure such a joy!</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">But before I go about assessing
        the merit of this 728x90-pixeled riddlemaster's challenge, or even consider a response to the challenge
        itself, I am met with a familiar adversary.
        <i style="text-align:left;">
            The Olive Garden</i>. The damnable temptress of Mediterranean fare
        <a href="/blogspot/offeryoucantrefuse" style="text-align:left;">has toyed with me before</a>. But my ire is only briefly stoked, and then
        quickly snuffed out, yielding to the rich, smoky scent of desire.
        <i style="text-align:left;">The fucking breadsticks</i>. I consider that maybe adversary is not a
        suitable word, so much as perhaps
        <i style="text-align:left;">adversavory</i>.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">But the crippling lust for an
        inexhaustible basket of garlicky loaves will not be useful on this perilous voyage. I'll need sharpened
        wits lest I make a grave misstep and completely fuck this up. Luckily I have the experience previously
        alluded to. I just have to piece the puzzle together.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">My first reaction was that this
        young man looked like Tom Hanks. This was further reinforced upon seeing his name among the possible
        choices! This is good news. I suppose all I have to do is click the...<br style="text-align:left;">
        <i style="text-align:left;"><br style="text-align:left;">
            Not so fast.</i></p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">I notice that as I let my cursor
        hover over the three candidates, Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, and Bruce Willis, the URL each one points to is
        exactly the same. Dia-fucking-bolical!
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">As I mutter a volume of
        Italian-specific profanity under my breath towards the unscrupulous Olive Garden, the clockwork upstairs
        is ticking away. This is
        <i style="text-align:left;">part of the test</i>. How will I react to this impasse? Which behavior will
        curry the most favor with the churlish devil operating this cyberspatial crypto-mindfuck?
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Politics, you will note if you
        read my previous adventure, plays as big a role as any. You will also note, as will I, that as much
        rapture it would bring me to enjoy a free meal at the premier bargain-crammer of American families'
        swollen pasta-holes, I am first and foremost a scientist. Just like Dr. Livingstone, who was likely
        passionate about his other pursuits like being a missionary and narrowly avoiding the kettles of hungry,
        barbarous brown men, he was first a scientist. Yes, this may not actually be
        <i style="text-align:left;">true</i>. But it is true for me.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">I should
        <i style="text-align:left;">test
        </i>this system. Misinform, as they say, and document the consequence. I have reserved the most fragile
        sliver of bandwidth for the possibility that since every link points to the same URL, every answer is
        correct. But the more dire contingency crowding the airspace in my mind, looming like some dark
        dirigible flagship for an evil army, is that somehow this banner
        <i style="text-align:left;">does
        </i>know when I've clicked a wrong answer, and a wrong answer is a hair trigger to release heaps upon
        smoldering heaps of internet scorn upon me (sometimes known as scornography), and even more importantly,
        resulting in a profound scarcity of piping, cheese-stuffed veal cutlets, and Caesar salads so big,
        Livingstone himself could start a fucking tribal
        <i style="text-align:left;">cult
        </i>inside one if he chose to do so.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">How would it know? Maybe the thing
        has a kind of mouse pixel tracker, sends this information to our truculent riddleskipper via the more
        silent 'POST' method, and catalogues your answer as either a correct "Hanks" answer, or an incorrect
        "Cruise", "Willis", or the letter "O" in the Olive Garden. It very well might then trace your IP and
        forever blacklist you from ever attempting this offer/brainteaser, or any affiliated one, or even
        setting foot within a 200 meter radius of anything resembling obscene portions of mass-produced Italian
        food.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">I've naturally broken into a cold
        sweat by now. But it soothes my nerves to know I've been here before, and this gives me strength. And
        with strength, courage. The courage to deliberately attempt to trip this thing up, and supply a wrong
        answer.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">I click "Tom Cruise". I am greeted
        with... greeted with...</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">I have trouble scribbling the
        notes into my trusty Moleskine pad as the tears well up in my quivering eyelids. Pearly Xanadu bathed in
        misty perfumes of Shangri-La, extending ambrosiatic splendors buoyed on the breath of sylphs and
        ivory-armed nymphs... can it be??</p>
    <p align="center">
        <MediaEmbed url="/archive/social/blogspot/oldblog/journey2.jpg" style="height:265px;width:500px;border-width: 0px; " /></p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">But I check my excitement, and
        retire to my empiricist's armchair. It certainly seems that one possibility I accounted for could be
        true; all answers could be treated as correct. But in the grandeur of the moment, my heart swelling at
        the sheer munificence of this portal of unattenuated Giving, I find that I'm more willing to call into
        question my assumption that Tom Hanks was really the right answer. Hell, maybe it was Tom Cruise. What
        do I know! I've never been that great with faces. But what I know for sure is, here I am staring into
        the face of legitimate evidence that the response "Tom Cruise" is a one way fucking ticket to linguini
        heaven. (Tom Cruise sure had funny hair back then!)</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Last time I did this, I blistered
        through the subsequent process to obtain my prize. Not this time. I will savor every step like it was a
        scalding mouthful of chicken &amp; gnocchi veronese. I will remind myself that I am doing this for
        <i style="text-align:left;">you</i>.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;"><b style="text-align:left;">The
        Turn.</b></p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">After I click the button to claim
        my dinner, that's when everything changes.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">It is at this point that I turn
        and say "I don't think we followed the white rabbit out of Kansas anymore, Toto. Let's see how far down
        this looking glass goes." That's what I
        <i style="text-align:left;">would
        </i>
        have said, if there were anyone to say it to. I just jotted it in my pad with a self-satisfied
        expression, deciding I would relate it to you folks later. </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">How far down did it go? Quite far.
        It just kept on going, in fact. I was met with
        <a href="/archive/social/blogspot/oldblog/offerslist.jpg" style="text-align:left;">screen after vertically-scrolling screen of first-tier promotional
            offers</a>. And that was just page one. I truly was like Alice tumbling head over heels after
        ingesting whatever hallucinogen triggered her Wonderland trip.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Now these all looked like fine
        offers. You might even argue (and I do, vociferously, by the way) that being lead to this dazzling
        buffet of discounted trades is reward enough alone for pegging a portrait as a dead ringer for a young
        Tom Cruise.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">But I'm a man on a mission. Not
        only am I attempting to optimize the likelihood of landing the gold at the end of the rainbow(tie pasta?
        Nah, forget it.), I'm also dabbling in some peculiar cross-pollinated form of journalism, and actually
        reporting on how this all works, and more importantly, how it makes me
        <i style="text-align:left;">feel</i>. Isn't that what I was calling this? Journalism? Wait... wasn't I
        calling it science? Is there even a difference? Hey, let's call it both. I'm adventurous enough for
        that. Sci-journalism. "Journ" is at the heart of journey, so it's making me feel a lot more fucking
        adventurous already. I will proceed to fantasize about myself as a plucky scijourneyman with a
        wind-twitched feather in my cap, and I invite you to as well.
    
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">On my scijourn, I'm faced with
        questions about how best to enrich the process, and augment my future breadstick intake. I will ask, "Is
        this best served by doing the bare minimum of 'any one sponsored offer'?" What would that say about me?
        It might say just about the same thing as if I worked in a family restaurant and only wore the minimum
        number buttons and silly trinkets on my suspenders required by management. To wit, an opportunity has
        been missed to truly express myself, and improve the perception of myself towards those who are
        bankrolling this whole goddamned endeavor. See what I mean about this being mostly about
        politics?</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Needless to say, I completed every
        offer on every page. It was grueling work, required dispensing a lot of personally invasive material,
        but it was worth it.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">I have not covered in detail any
        of the offers from this "Grand Freefall List", because believe it or not, this is only step fucking one
        of Olive Garden's program requirements. I'll go into more depth on the palette of main offers which
        follow.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">The best is yet to come.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;"><b style="text-align:left;">The
        Prestigious Unrelenting Clusterfuck Siege of Neverending Yet Highly Enticing Semi-Mandatory Offers.</b>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Now comes the fun part. It's a
        kind of revolving menu, sort of like in a jukebox, of more detailed offers. It's unclear how many of
        these are really mandatory to complete the deal. I'd guess at least one, but maybe more. But that's
        missing the point. If you look closely, there's even more free shit you can snag if you take some of
        these really choice proposals seriously. I know I did. Every last one.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Here's the first one. A smoking
        survey! This sounds great. Remember about the political angle. Here, the obvious thing to do is pretend
        you're a smoker, and that you smoke
        <i style="text-align:left;">a lot</i>.</p>
    <p align="center">
        <MediaEmbed url="/archive/social/blogspot/oldblog/journey3.jpg" style="height:769px;width:622px;border-width: 0px; " /></p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Notice that in order to make
        yourself eligible for the 5 grand, you have to certify that everything you said is true. This made me a
        little nervous, so I used a fake name. I figure this ought to throw off the feds for at least a little
        while, and still allow me to claim the prize as Mr. E. Johnson, with the liberal use of a fake
        moustache.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Next up: Holy shit, another 5
        grand?? At this rate I'll be a millionaire before I'm ever seated at Olive Garden. How ironic, being
        exorbitantly wealthy, yet dining at a place where a measly few bucks buys you INFINITY breadsticks.
        Those populist motherfuckers.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <MediaEmbed url="/archive/social/blogspot/oldblog/journey4.jpg" style="height:798px;width:697px;border-width: 0px; " /></p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">There are a few things to notice
        about this promotion.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">First ...</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">IT IS A TICKING TIME
        BOMB!!!</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">It's already down to 12 minutes
        and 31 seconds before it expires! Jesus Christ, talk about getting here in the nick of time! The other
        thing to note is that it requires your home phone number. I guess this makes sense, because in the off
        chance that you get the ringtones instead of the 5K, how else are they going to jack your tones up into
        your phone? End of argument for me.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Besides, I didn't have a whole lot
        of time to bat around issues of privacy or misuse of personal information when there was just a little
        less than
        <i style="text-align:left;">a baker's goddamned dozen minutes left to make up my mind</i>. And anyway,
        you can tell they guard this information with encryption protocols since it masks the numbers with '*'
        symbols. At least I know the busybody looking over my shoulder isn't going to be making any prank phone
        calls to me, while an elite team of data guardians handles my digits with velvet gloves afar.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Oh yeah, and I had just enough
        time to hit the checkbox to nab myself another 10K. Booyeah.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Ok, then things started getting a
        little weird.</p>
    <p align="center">
        <MediaEmbed url="/archive/social/blogspot/oldblog/journey5.jpg" style="height:694px;width:613px;border-width: 0px; " /></p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Diapers? Nobody is a bigger fan of
        accumulating useless shit through debilitatingly extensive promos than I am, but what am I going to do
        with diapers?</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">I don't really want to turn down
        the offer and ruffle any feathers, so I decided to just pretend I only spoke Spanish and ignored the
        form.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">With the next offer, things got
        back on a more even keel. What's not to like about being greeted by the warm smile of Ray Romano? I
        found nothing strange or silly about this promotion at all.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <MediaEmbed url="/archive/social/blogspot/oldblog/journey6.jpg" style="height:833px;width:626px;border-width: 0px; " /></p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">I felt pretty good about my
        chances on that one. I was starting to get in a groove. I was feeling good, like there was no tidbit
        about myself too compromising, embarrassing, or financially lacerating to expose to a conglomerate of
        vague internet shadow-businesses.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">Then this one rolled around and I
        tipped backwards a bit, crushing my chair comedically. Finally something that addresses my one greatest
        need. My gaping, unfathomable ignorance of things!</p>
    <p align="center">
        <MediaEmbed url="/archive/social/blogspot/oldblog/journey7.jpg" style="height:833px;width:626px;border-width: 0px; " /></p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">After filling about another 50 or
        60 of these, they started getting pretty weird again.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <MediaEmbed url="/archive/social/blogspot/oldblog/journey8.jpg" style="height:833px;width:626px;border-width: 0px; " /></p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">And they just kept going downhill.
    </p>
    <p align="center">
        <MediaEmbed url="/archive/social/blogspot/oldblog/journey9.jpg" style="height:833px;width:626px;border-width: 0px; " /></p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">There didn't appear to be an end
        in sight to the promos. In fact, I am still on this journey, albeit taking a break, resting on the back
        of some kind of mythical creature that looks like a turtle. I'm not sure if I'll ever come out, but I'll
        keep recording what I find. Maybe someone can stop by my place with a few external hard drives to store
        the volume of cookies, spyware and other temporary files which have gathered on my disc. It's been taxed
        like an old mule.
    
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">For now, I will venture that there
        is no bottom to this heinous spiderhole I've fallen into. Only glittering distractions to slow my
        descent. Send help.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">And breadsticks.</p>
    <p style="text-align:left;">&nbsp;</p></div>
