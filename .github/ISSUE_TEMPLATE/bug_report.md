This is for reporting bugs with the program **only**. 
This is *not* a place for general technical support. Do not use this section for "How do I..." questions.

Before reporting a bug:
- Read the FAQ: https://homestuck.giovanh.com/unofficial-homestuck-collection/faq.html
- Make absolutely sure your exact issue hasn't already been identified in the pinned issue list
- Search the issues to see your problem is already being tracked.
- See if the issue has already been fixed in the latest prerelease build
- See if the issue has already been fixed in the `develop` branch (if possible)

Don't leave this section in your post.
