      <description>
        <p>Known Issue: If you delete the old Asset Pack V1 before launching version 2.0 of the
          program for the first time, you'll get a javascript error. This can be avoided by deleting
          Asset Pack V1 after setting up version 2.0, or you can recover from the problem by
          deleting your %appdata%/unofficial-homestuck-collection folder.</p>

        <p>This is the initial release of The Unofficial Homestuck Collection!</p>
        <p>Requires V1 of the Asset Pack to function. You'll have to find it elsewhere, sorry! Once
          you've got it downloaded, you'll have to tell the application where to find it during the
          initial startup process. After that, you're set!</p>
